INFORMATION FAIR TRADE SCHEME COMMITMENT
I am personally committed to making sure that we trade in information fairly. To show the
strength of this commitment, my organisation has achieved Information Fair Trader
accreditation from the Controller of Her Majesty's Stationery Office (HMSO). In order to
maintain the standards achieved during accreditation I will ensure that we have the
necessary systems and checks in piace to enable me to support the following statement with
confidence.
I will ensure that we strictly follow an open and transparent system of trading that meets the
principles of the Competition Act 1998. My aim is that, subject to applicable legislation and
wider MOD policy constraints, we can meet the needs of anyone who applies for a licence to
re-use information that falls within my delegated authority for any purpose. We will publish
our policy on reuse on our website and apply it fairly and equitably
We set prices, and methods for determining prices (such as royalty schemes), in line with
applicable HMSO guidance and industry best practice. We publish them on our website and
apply them fairly and equitably. Any exceptions are described in full on the website and are
available to anyone who qualifies for them
I am committed to reducing as far as possible the administrative burden on people who re-
use public sector information. I will make sure that where appropriate we use processes for
trading information that are in line with those of the rest of the public sector.
I will investigate any complaints I receive that my organisation has broken this commitment
and I will make the results of these investigations available to the Office of Public Sector
Information. If the OPSI decide to review a complaint, I will, subject to the applicable security
requirements being met, allow the OPSI review team to see the relevant staff and records.

Port of Falmouth Development Initiative: maerl 'recovery' report
Aims
Provide independent expert opinion on likely 'recovery rates of maerl following proposed navigation
channel dredging in Falmouth Harbour.
Meet Nicola Solly at Royal Haskoning Exeter Office on 1t September 2009 to run through details
of the dredging proposals and maerl studies already undertaken
Review analyses that Royal Haskoning has undertaken of the maerl survey data
Review relevant sections of the Environmental Statement and supporting information
Supplement any knowledge from the existing scientific and grey literature
Provide expert opinion on likely 'recovery' rates (in terms of numbers of years) with a detailed
commentary explaining the reasoning behind this
Introduction
In this short report I provide independent expert advice on the rate at which maerl bed communities
within the proposed dredge area might re-colonise after deepening of the navigation channel if
mitigation measures are put in place. To do this I have examined the most relevant parts of the Port of
Falmouth Development Initiative Environmental Statement (31 July 2009), namely Chapters 1
(Introduction), 2 (Project Description), 5 (Hydrodynamic and sediment regime), 8 (Coastal ecology), 24
(Implications for the designated status of the Fal and Helford Estuaries SAC) and Appendix C (Marine
Ecology) In addition I have examined the raw data and analyses carried out in house by Royal
Haskoning to assess post-dredging maerl recovery rates within the Fal Estuary (Royal Haskoning, 2004
2008). I report on my opinions of Chapters 8 and 24 of the Environmental Statement and the maerl
monitoring assessments provided by Royal Haskoning (2004, 2008)
1
Chapter 8 Marine and Coastal Ecolo
Chapter 8 argues that the proposed capital dredging would have 'major adverse impact' unless
the proposed mitigation plan was implemented, but that if maerl is replaced on the seabed at the
eastern end of the navigation channel then the proposal would have 'minor adverse residual impact
This Chapter first describes how the proposed capital dredging would cause loss of live maerl
and that without mitigation this would result in the loss of approximately four hectares of maerl gravel
habitat. Given the scale of this loss and the sensitivity of the SAC, the Environmental Statement asserts
that this would represent a ‘major adverse impact. This is because the proposed dredging site lies
within an SAC where maerl habitats that are 1000s of years old (Hall-Spencer 1998, Bosence & Wilson,
2003) are one of the primary features of conservation importance as they are rare around the coasts of
England. Maerl is a UK listed priority habitat and its Biodiversity Action Plan states the objectives of
maintaining its range, variety and quality. Tyler & Hiscock (2005) are cited as noting that maerl is 'highly
intolerant' of 'substratum loss", ‘smothering', 'changes in suspended sediment, and 'abrasion and
physical disturbance'. Hall-Spencer et a (2006) and Nelson (2009) provide updates on the
environmental tolerances of maerl which strengthen the body of scientific evidence that these habitats
are intolerant of substratum loss, smothering, changes in suspended sediment, abrasion and physical
disturbance. The Environmental Statement argues that increased sedimentation due to the proposed
dredging is expected to have a 'minor adverse impact' on the surrounding maerl and its associated
benthic infauna. I agree with the arguments that the live maerl beds located off St Mawes would
probably not be affected by the proposed dredging. However, given the weight of published evidence
showing the vulnerability of live maerl to smothering with silt, I would anticipate that any live maerl
adjacent to the proposed dredging channel would be killed (i.e. major adverse impact') I consider that
the planned use of a backhoe dredger for channel deepening is a good choice as this will suspend less
sediment than suction dredging. estimate that this will restrict the smothering of live maerl to a 20 m
zone around the dredge channel, based on a combination of my knowledge of the effects of siltation on
live maerl caused by scallop dredging (Hall-Spencer & Moore, 2000) and an examination of Chapter 5 of
the Environmental Statement (Hydrodynamic and sediment regime)
To mitigate the impact of dredging it is proposed that coarse maerl gravel (i.e. maerl with a low
silt content) from the central/western part of the proposed dredging area be redistributed over an
estimated 6 hectare area of seabed at the eastern end of the proposed dredge channel in a layer 1 m
thick. Annex C of the Environmental Statement (Axelsson et al. 2008) shows that live maerl was
recorded in 8/10 of the core samples taken from the proposed dredging channel, with abundant live
maerl in 2/10 samples and frequent live maerl in 3/10 of the samples. Chapter 8 of the Environmental
Statement acknowledges that live maerl in the dredged area will be killed, but the idea behind the
proposed mitigation plan is to use a backhoe dredge to put dead maerl back to allow recolonisation of
maerl communities and to help reduce dredging effects from 'major adverse impact' to a 'minor adverse
residual impact. Such classifications are subjective however, Natural England may argue that the loss of
a mature maerl community with scattered live maerl remains a 'major adverse impact' despite the
proposed mitigation efforts. Axelsson et al. (2008) found that the sedimentary habitat within the
proposed dredging footprint had the high species richness that is typical of maerl-associated
communities. They also found that this area has the only known UK records of the tanaidacean
Leptognathis paramanca, a species which is being considered for statutory conservation protection. In
my opinion L. paramanca may be widespread in maerl deposits within the Fal and Helford SAC but may
have gone unnoticed as many previous surveys of this habitat did not identify specimens to species level
(e.g. Royal Haskoning 2004, 2008). Use of a backhoe dredge to place maerl onto the seabed is a good
choice as this will reduce the impact of plumes of suspended sediment which would otherwise be
expected if the maerl was simply dumped overboard. While the dredged maerl is stored on barges I
would expect the sediment to become anoxic as the inhabitants of the maerl die and rot, raising
concerns about the rate at which this anoxic sediment might take to recolonise
I agree with the advice within the Environmental Statement that, if navigation channel dredging
goes ahead, then the proposed mitigation exercise is a valid attempt to avoid adverse impacts on the
integrity of the Fal and Helford SAC. I also agree with the recommendation that the coarse maerl gravel
be redistributed in a layer 1 m thick. This is because long-lived elements of the fauna that typify
established maerl communities are known to burrow deeply (70 cm) into maerl deposits (Hall-Spencer
& Atkinson, 1999). I would caution that it is difficult to predict whether the mitigation will work,
especially since translocation of maerl habitat has not been attempted before. We can not assume that
the granulometry of the coarse maerl gravel laid onto the proposed overdredged area at the eastern
end of the channel will not be altered by the subsequent build-up of sand and/or silt. Given that sand
and silty maerl gravel sediments are present in the proposed mitigation area at present (Chapter 5), my
opinion is that coarse maerl gravel could become inundated by other sediment types over the coming
decades and that as a consequence the coarse maerl gravel habitat type that would be removed from
the central/western part of the proposed dredging channel would be lost in perpetuity
Chapter 8 posits that a 'relatively small proportion of dead maerl habitat within the SAC is likely
to be affected. It would be useful to know how this estimate was reached as 1) live maerl wil be
removed and killed, and 2) an estimate of % loss of maerl habitat within the SAC has not been
attempted. A GIS map of the known live and dead areas of maerl habitat within the SAC would help
enlighten discussions and decisions about the proposal as it and may strengthen (or weaken) the
argument that the proposed dredging programme will not affect the integrity of the SAC.
Maerl 'recover
No data exist on the recovery of maerl beds that have been dredged from one place and put in
another, although there have been assessments of the ecological consequences of the disposal of other
types of dredged material around the coastline of England and Wales that show that the communities
within such sites generally have an impoverished fauna, although the degree of impact is highly site-
specific (Bolam et al. 2006). On the basis of published work on the effects of dredging on maerl bed
ecology (de Grave & Whitaker 2000; Hall-Spencer & Moore 2000; Hauton et al. 2003) I consider it likely
that moving a maerl bed would have strong effects on the structure and composition of the community
that eventually becomes established within the translocated sediment. The benthic community is
unlikely to return to the same community composition as that found in the central/western end of the
proposed dredging channel as there will be long-term effects of the disturbance itself (e.g. death of live
maerl upon which maerl generation ultimately depends) as well as differences in parameters such as
wave exposure, currents and sediment granulometry that will determine the eventual composition of
the benthic community. However, it may be that a different and yet ecologically healthy maerl
community could develop over time thanks to mitigation, where useful ecosystem goods and services
are provided by the translocated maerl. agree with McCauley (1977) that 'recovery is the wrong term
to use when studying post-dredging re-colonisation processes as it not only implies a return to prior
abundance levels, but also a return to ecological pathways which may have taken years to develop. In
an analysis of re-colonization processes following cessation of maerl dredging in Ireland, De Grave &
Whitaker (2000) found clear differences in the benthos between dredged and fallow sites but they were
unable to determine whether there had been a return to pre-dredging conditions as there were no pre-
dredge data. However, they noted that several studies on other sediment types had shown changes in
the relative contribution of the major taxonomic groups following dredging abatement
4
Chapter 8 assesses the likely rates of re-colonization of maerl in the mitigation zone, based on
data analyses by Royal Haskoning (2004, 2008) and Axellson et al. (2008). Royal Haskoning (2004)
compares hand-held core samples taken in July 2003 with those taken in July 2004 at maerl sites within
the Fal 1) that had never been dredged, 2) where low-levels of maerl extraction had occurred in 2003-4,
3) where levels of maerl extraction increased to high levels in 2003-4 and 4) where maerl extraction had
ceased in 2003, following a previous 15 year period of dredging. Their analyses show the high degree of
inter-annual variability that can be obtained in core sample studies of maerl beds, even if the sampling
season is standardised. Within the undredged areas, for instance, the abundance of fauna at some
stations dropped by two thirds in July 2004 (cf. July 2003) whereas at another reference station the
abundance of fauna had increased over the same time period. Royal Haskoning (2004) also show the
marked effect that high levels of maerl extraction can have, transforming an area of maerl that was the
richest area recorded in 2003 (76 taxa) to the most impoverished benthic community in 2004 (15 taxa)
These data are consistent with what would be expected in heavily dredged areas. At all of the other
sites studied there was such a high variability in numbers of taxa and their abundances that no
significant trends from 2003-2004. At the site where maerl extraction had ceased in 2003, two of the
three stations sampled showed increases in the average numbers of taxa and abundances of organisms
per core but these increases were not statistically significant. Royal Haskoning (2004) recommended
that longer-term monitoring of the maerl was needed to assess 'recovery' of the communities present
Given the variability in the abundances of the species that occur in maerl core samples it may be
sensible to consider the functional capacity (or health) of these ecosystems rather than simply the range
and proportions of species present (see Cooper et al., 2008). One way in which this could be measures
is to use air-lift sampling to assess the population structure of long-lived infauna such as the brood stock
of adult bivalves
I have not carried out ecological studies of maerl deposits within the Fal and Helford Estuary SAC
so have to draw on my experience of studies of maerl habitats in Brittany and Scotland to inform my
opinion of the Environmental Assessment. During the course of these studies I have learnt that replicate
15 cm long, 11 cm diameter hand-held core samples provide a good means of monitoring the small and
abundant sessile fauna that occur in surface sediments (e.g. Davies et al. 2001; Hall-Spencer & Bamber,
2007). However, this sampling methodology is not suited to an assessment of large, long-lived
inhabitants of maerl beds which are more sparsely distributed and often occur below the depth to which
hand-held diver cores can penetrate. Axelsson et al. (2008) noted that biomass records were extremely
variable within the proposed dredge area, and depended on whether large organisms such as Paphia

Port of Falmouth Development Initiative: maerl 'recovery' report
Aims
Provide independent expert opinion on likely 'recovery rates of maerl following proposed navigation
channel dredging in Falmouth Harbour.
Meet Nicola Solly at Royal Haskoning Exeter Office on 1t September 2009 to run through details
of the dredging proposals and maerl studies already undertaken
Review analyses that Royal Haskoning has undertaken of the maerl survey data
Review relevant sections of the Environmental Statement and supporting information
Supplement any knowledge from the existing scientific and grey literature
Provide expert opinion on likely 'recovery' rates (in terms of numbers of years) with a detailed
commentary explaining the reasoning behind this
Introduction
In this short report I provide independent expert advice on the rate at which maerl bed communities
within the proposed dredge area might re-colonise after deepening of the navigation channel if
mitigation measures are put in place. To do this I have examined the most relevant parts of the Port of
Falmouth Development Initiative Environmental Statement (31 July 2009), namely Chapters 1
(Introduction), 2 (Project Description), 5 (Hydrodynamic and sediment regime), 8 (Coastal ecology), 24
(Implications for the designated status of the Fal and Helford Estuaries SAC) and Appendix C (Marine
Ecology) In addition I have examined the raw data and analyses carried out in house by Royal
Haskoning to assess post-dredging maerl recovery rates within the Fal Estuary (Royal Haskoning, 2004
2008). I report on my opinions of Chapters 8 and 24 of the Environmental Statement and the maerl
monitoring assessments provided by Royal Haskoning (2004, 2008)
1
Chapter 8 Marine and Coastal Ecolo
Chapter 8 argues that the proposed capital dredging would have 'major adverse impact' unless
the proposed mitigation plan was implemented, but that if maerl is replaced on the seabed at the
eastern end of the navigation channel then the proposal would have 'minor adverse residual impact
This Chapter first describes how the proposed capital dredging would cause loss of live maerl
and that without mitigation this would result in the loss of approximately four hectares of maerl gravel
habitat. Given the scale of this loss and the sensitivity of the SAC, the Environmental Statement asserts
that this would represent a ‘major adverse impact. This is because the proposed dredging site lies
within an SAC where maerl habitats that are 1000s of years old (Hall-Spencer 1998, Bosence & Wilson,
2003) are one of the primary features of conservation importance as they are rare around the coasts of
England. Maerl is a UK listed priority habitat and its Biodiversity Action Plan states the objectives of
maintaining its range, variety and quality. Tyler & Hiscock (2005) are cited as noting that maerl is 'highly
intolerant' of 'substratum loss", ‘smothering', 'changes in suspended sediment, and 'abrasion and
physical disturbance'. Hall-Spencer et a (2006) and Nelson (2009) provide updates on the
environmental tolerances of maerl which strengthen the body of scientific evidence that these habitats
are intolerant of substratum loss, smothering, changes in suspended sediment, abrasion and physical
disturbance. The Environmental Statement argues that increased sedimentation due to the proposed
dredging is expected to have a 'minor adverse impact' on the surrounding maerl and its associated
benthic infauna. I agree with the arguments that the live maerl beds located off St Mawes would
probably not be affected by the proposed dredging. However, given the weight of published evidence
showing the vulnerability of live maerl to smothering with silt, I would anticipate that any live maerl
adjacent to the proposed dredging channel would be killed (i.e. major adverse impact') I consider that
the planned use of a backhoe dredger for channel deepening is a good choice as this will suspend less
sediment than suction dredging. estimate that this will restrict the smothering of live maerl to a 20 m
zone around the dredge channel, based on a combination of my knowledge of the effects of siltation on
live maerl caused by scallop dredging (Hall-Spencer & Moore, 2000) and an examination of Chapter 5 of
the Environmental Statement (Hydrodynamic and sediment regime)
To mitigate the impact of dredging it is proposed that coarse maerl gravel (i.e. maerl with a low
silt content) from the central/western part of the proposed dredging area be redistributed over an
estimated 6 hectare area of seabed at the eastern end of the proposed dredge channel in a layer 1 m
thick. Annex C of the Environmental Statement (Axelsson et al. 2008) shows that live maerl was
recorded in 8/10 of the core samples taken from the proposed dredging channel, with abundant live
maerl in 2/10 samples and frequent live maerl in 3/10 of the samples. Chapter 8 of the Environmental
Statement acknowledges that live maerl in the dredged area will be killed, but the idea behind the
proposed mitigation plan is to use a backhoe dredge to put dead maerl back to allow recolonisation of
maerl communities and to help reduce dredging effects from 'major adverse impact' to a 'minor adverse
residual impact. Such classifications are subjective however, Natural England may argue that the loss of
a mature maerl community with scattered live maerl remains a 'major adverse impact' despite the
proposed mitigation efforts. Axelsson et al. (2008) found that the sedimentary habitat within the
proposed dredging footprint had the high species richness that is typical of maerl-associated
communities. They also found that this area has the only known UK records of the tanaidacean
Leptognathis paramanca, a species which is being considered for statutory conservation protection. In
my opinion L. paramanca may be widespread in maerl deposits within the Fal and Helford SAC but may
have gone unnoticed as many previous surveys of this habitat did not identify specimens to species level
(e.g. Royal Haskoning 2004, 2008). Use of a backhoe dredge to place maerl onto the seabed is a good
choice as this will reduce the impact of plumes of suspended sediment which would otherwise be
expected if the maerl was simply dumped overboard. While the dredged maerl is stored on barges I
would expect the sediment to become anoxic as the inhabitants of the maerl die and rot, raising
concerns about the rate at which this anoxic sediment might take to recolonise
I agree with the advice within the Environmental Statement that, if navigation channel dredging
goes ahead, then the proposed mitigation exercise is a valid attempt to avoid adverse impacts on the
integrity of the Fal and Helford SAC. I also agree with the recommendation that the coarse maerl gravel
be redistributed in a layer 1 m thick. This is because long-lived elements of the fauna that typify
established maerl communities are known to burrow deeply (70 cm) into maerl deposits (Hall-Spencer
& Atkinson, 1999). I would caution that it is difficult to predict whether the mitigation will work,
especially since translocation of maerl habitat has not been attempted before. We can not assume that
the granulometry of the coarse maerl gravel laid onto the proposed overdredged area at the eastern
end of the channel will not be altered by the subsequent build-up of sand and/or silt. Given that sand
and silty maerl gravel sediments are present in the proposed mitigation area at present (Chapter 5), my
opinion is that coarse maerl gravel could become inundated by other sediment types over the coming
decades and that as a consequence the coarse maerl gravel habitat type that would be removed from
the central/western part of the proposed dredging channel would be lost in perpetuity
Chapter 8 posits that a 'relatively small proportion of dead maerl habitat within the SAC is likely
to be affected. It would be useful to know how this estimate was reached as 1) live maerl wil be
removed and killed, and 2) an estimate of % loss of maerl habitat within the SAC has not been
attempted. A GIS map of the known live and dead areas of maerl habitat within the SAC would help
enlighten discussions and decisions about the proposal as it and may strengthen (or weaken) the
argument that the proposed dredging programme will not affect the integrity of the SAC.
Maerl 'recover
No data exist on the recovery of maerl beds that have been dredged from one place and put in
another, although there have been assessments of the ecological consequences of the disposal of other
types of dredged material around the coastline of England and Wales that show that the communities
within such sites generally have an impoverished fauna, although the degree of impact is highly site-
specific (Bolam et al. 2006). On the basis of published work on the effects of dredging on maerl bed
ecology (de Grave & Whitaker 2000; Hall-Spencer & Moore 2000; Hauton et al. 2003) I consider it likely
that moving a maerl bed would have strong effects on the structure and composition of the community
that eventually becomes established within the translocated sediment. The benthic community is
unlikely to return to the same community composition as that found in the central/western end of the
proposed dredging channel as there will be long-term effects of the disturbance itself (e.g. death of live
maerl upon which maerl generation ultimately depends) as well as differences in parameters such as
wave exposure, currents and sediment granulometry that will determine the eventual composition of
the benthic community. However, it may be that a different and yet ecologically healthy maerl
community could develop over time thanks to mitigation, where useful ecosystem goods and services
are provided by the translocated maerl. agree with McCauley (1977) that 'recovery is the wrong term
to use when studying post-dredging re-colonisation processes as it not only implies a return to prior
abundance levels, but also a return to ecological pathways which may have taken years to develop. In
an analysis of re-colonization processes following cessation of maerl dredging in Ireland, De Grave &
Whitaker (2000) found clear differences in the benthos between dredged and fallow sites but they were
unable to determine whether there had been a return to pre-dredging conditions as there were no pre-
dredge data. However, they noted that several studies on other sediment types had shown changes in
the relative contribution of the major taxonomic groups following dredging abatement

Chapter 8 assesses the likely rates of re-colonization of maerl in the mitigation zone, based on
data analyses by Royal Haskoning (2004, 2008) and Axellson et al. (2008). Royal Haskoning (2004)
compares hand-held core samples taken in July 2003 with those taken in July 2004 at maerl sites within
the Fal 1) that had never been dredged, 2) where low-levels of maerl extraction had occurred in 2003-4,
3) where levels of maerl extraction increased to high levels in 2003-4 and 4) where maerl extraction had
ceased in 2003, following a previous 15 year period of dredging. Their analyses show the high degree of
inter-annual variability that can be obtained in core sample studies of maerl beds, even if the sampling
season is standardised. Within the undredged areas, for instance, the abundance of fauna at some
stations dropped by two thirds in July 2004 (cf. July 2003) whereas at another reference station the
abundance of fauna had increased over the same time period. Royal Haskoning (2004) also show the
marked effect that high levels of maerl extraction can have, transforming an area of maerl that was the
richest area recorded in 2003 (76 taxa) to the most impoverished benthic community in 2004 (15 taxa)
These data are consistent with what would be expected in heavily dredged areas. At all of the other
sites studied there was such a high variability in numbers of taxa and their abundances that no
significant trends from 2003-2004. At the site where maerl extraction had ceased in 2003, two of the
three stations sampled showed increases in the average numbers of taxa and abundances of organisms
per core but these increases were not statistically significant. Royal Haskoning (2004) recommended
that longer-term monitoring of the maerl was needed to assess 'recovery' of the communities present
Given the variability in the abundances of the species that occur in maerl core samples it may be
sensible to consider the functional capacity (or health) of these ecosystems rather than simply the range
and proportions of species present (see Cooper et al., 2008). One way in which this could be measures
is to use air-lift sampling to assess the population structure of long-lived infauna such as the brood stock

Solly, N.S. (Royal Haskoning) and Knowles, H (Falmouth Harbour Commissioners
25/11/2009
1. Brief:
The purpose of this study was to calcułate the surface area of maerl habitat in the Fal and
Helford Special Area of Conservation (SAC) using existing data sources on the distribution of
maerl within the area. This is being undertaken to inform the discussions on the FEPA
license currently under consideration for the Port of Falmouth Development Initiative
(PFDI), which includes dredging of maerl within the Fal estuary.
2. Methodology:
The assessment was carried out using existing data on the distribution of maerl within the
SAC. The following surveys/ data sources were used (no new survey work was carried out
for this assessment);
. Davies and Sotheran, 1995;
» Hardiman et al, 1976;
» Ruiz-Frau et al, 2007 on behalf of Cornish Sea Fisheries Commission; and
SeaStar Survey 2007.
This study has concentrated on the distribution of dead rather than live maerl. This is
because the maerl beds that will be affected by the PDFI comprise predominantly dead
maerl with a small proportion of live maerl on the surface. The live maerl bank off St Mawes
is not predicted to be affected by the scheme (see the PFDI Environmental Statement (Royal
Haskoning, 2009) for further details)
Using EasyCAD 7 software, a map was produced showing the locations where dead maerl
has been record as being present or absent. In order to estimate the area of maerl within
the SAC, it was decided to map the areas where dead maerl is the dominant sediment on
the seabed. This was defined as being locations where dead maerl has been recorded as
comprising at least 50% of the sediment recorded at a sampling location or the survey had
recorded it as being the dominant substrate (further detail presented below).
2.1Analysing abundance
2.1.1 DAFOR method
Two of the investigations (SeaStar Survey, 2007 and Hardiman et al, 1976) visually assessed
the nature of the sediments on the seabed and classified the abundance of maerl according
to the well-known DAFOR scale. The percentage cover of maerl on the seabed at each
sampling station was described according to the following classification:
D-dominant->75% maerl cover
A-abundant-51-75% maerl cover
F-frequent-26-50% maerl cover
O-occasional 11-25% maerl cover
R-rare-0-10% maerl cover
For the purposes of this study, all sampling stations where maerl was recorded as being
dominant or abundant (i.e. more than 50%) were included.
2.1.2 Davies and Sotheran
The Davies and Sotheran investigation mapped the distribution of maerl and other habitats
in the SAC. The study was undertaken using RoxAnn acoustic system supported by direct
observation of the sea bed using drop-down video camera and sediment samples collected
by grab. At each of the video and grab stations, the seabed was classified according to the
biotope present. Twelve biotopes were recorded in total of which 4 recorded are
considered to be dominated by maerl. These were biotope codes 4, 5, 6 and 7 referred to in
Table 1 of the report. Locations where these biotopes were present were therefore
included in this study as maerl is considered to be the dominant sediment in these locations.
2.1.3 CFSC study
The CSFC study involved grab sampling at eight stations and taking video recording along six
transects. Only the grab sampling data is presented in the report in sufficient detail to be
able to use in this assessment. Locations where the sediment types for the grab samples
were described as maerl gravel, were included in the study.
2.2
Mapping of areas
Figure 1 shows the locations where maerl is recorded as being dominant. In order to
estimate the area of maerl, a series of polygons were drawn around these locations in
EasyCAD. These were drawn using the following assumptions:
Where there are two stations recorded as maerl being dominant, it is assumed that
maerl dominates the sediments between these two stations
It is assumed that the boundary between maerl being present and absent lies
equidistant between stations where maerl is being recorded as present and absent
It should be noted that in practise one sediment type is likely to gradually grade into
another often with a poorly defined boundary
o
Using these polygons, the predicted area of maerl was calculated. This has been compared
he area of the Fal and Helford SAC to estimate the percentage cover of the maerl
hapitat.
In light of how the results of this study will be used, it is important that a pre-cautionary
approach is adopted and that the area of maerl is not over-estimated. It is was therefore
decided to apply a scaling factor to the results of the study to account for the fact that there
is likely to be natural variability in the sediment types across the study area and that despite
the best efforts to map the distribution accurately, it is likely that maerl is not present
continuously across the areas where maerl is recorded as being dominant. A scaling factor
of 30% was therefore used and the calculated areas were multiplied by 0.7 to reduce them
by this factor.
It should be noted that although maerl is not likely to be present 100% continuously across
the identified areas, maerl is also likely to be present outside of these areas, which has not
been recorded by any of the surveys due to the distances between sampling stations.
Therefore the results of this study probably represent an underestimate of the
maerl within the SAC.

3. Results:
The results of the assessment are presented in Figure 1 and Table 1. The results of the
assessment have been compared to the biotope map in Davies and Sotheran (1994). They
appear broadly consistent with Davies and Sotheran (1994) who recorded that "Falmouth
Bay was predominantly sedimentary with the sediment mainly dead maerl or maeri derivatives".
Each polygon where maerl is predicted to be dominant was identified with a number (1-4)
and the area of each is identified in Table 1. The total area of dead maerl within the SAC is
962 hectares (including a 30% scaling factor). The SAC covers an area of 6397 hectares
(JNCC, [online]) and therefore, the percentage of the Fal and Helford SAC covered by dead
maerl is approximately 15%

This is a record of the appropriate assessment, required by Regulation 48 of the Habitats Regulations
1994, undertaken by Falmouth Harbour Commissioners in respect of the above plan/project, in
accordance with the Habitats Directive (Council Directive 92/43/EEC). Having considered that the plan
or project would be likely to have a significant effect on the Fal and Helford Special Area of
Conservationand that the plan or project was not directly connected with or necessary to the
management of the site, an appropriate assessment has been undertaken of the implications of the
proposal in view of the site's conservation objectives.
English Nature was consulted under Regulation 48(3) on (date) and their representations, to which this
authority has had regard, are attached at Annex 1. The conclusions of this appropriate assessment are
not in accordance with the advice and recommendations of English Nature
The site's conservation of objectives have been taken into account, including consideration of the
citation for the site and information supplied by English Nature (see Annex 1). The likely effects of the

summarised as:
The Board concluded that the PFDI will not have an adverse effect on the
integrity of the Fal and Helford Estuaries SAC, either alone, or in-combination
with other plans and projects. The reason for this conclusion is that less than 2%
of dead maerl within the SACl be affected by the proposals and only in the
medium term. This scale of impact is of not sufficient magnitude to affect the
overall coherence of the SAC's ecological structure and function, particularly as
the affected habitat will begin to recover and make a contribution to the site

Dear Nicola
Re Information for Appropriate Assessment on Port of Falmouth Development Initiative
Thank you for your draft report dated 20h May 2010 setting out the information required by
Falmouth Harbour Commissioners and Falmouth Docks and Engineering Company to
produce an appropriate assessment
In my letter to the Marine & Fisheries Agency dated 15th September 2009, I set out details of
three areas of concern regarding the likely impact of the proposed dredge and replacement
of maerl, namely:
. Destruction of the maerl matrix
.
.
.
Burying of live maerl
Predicted rates of sedimentation
Over optimistic rates of recovery
In the 20h May document Royal Haskonning suggests in the conclusion that "... it is open to
FHC and FDEC to conclude that the PFDI will not have an adverse effect on the integrity of
the Fal & Helford SAC " . This is based on the estimate that less than 2% of dead maerl
within the SAC will be affected by the proposals and only in the medium term." As Relevant
Authorities, FHC and FDEC are at liberty to draw their own conclusions in their appropriate
assessment following consultation with Natural England. However we would advise that we
believe that the argument of no adverse effect on the integrity of the site based on the
percentage impacted is false. Previous case law supports this, for example in the decision
regarding Barksore Marshes in Kent, the planning inspector concluded
" I am aware of no policy guidance to suggest that even small losses (of, say 5% or
1%) of a valued habitat within an SPA should be regarded as acceptable."
As the maerl deposits have a limited European distribution, and the Fal and Helford SAC
represents the only significant occurrence of such habitats in England, Natural England
believe that the potential losses due to the dredge and replacement of maerl as part of the
PFDI cannot be regarded as insignificant
It is further argued by Royal Haskonning that integrity of the SAC will be maintained as the
extent of maerl within the SAC will be preserved by the replacement of dredged maerl with
maerl re-deposited at the eastern section of the dredge area. Indeed, it is further argued that
the area of pure maerl will be increased as a result of the dredge and replacement. Royal
Haskonning argue that "...neither habitat (of maerl) is more valuable than the other.
In the Fal and Helford Management scheme, agreed to and signed by FHC and FDEC,
Conservation Objective 3 (part of the regulation 33 advice package) is "To maintain thee
SUBTIDAL SANDBANKS in 'favourable condition', taking account of natural change, with
particular reference to
. Eelgrass bed communities
. Maerl bed communities
. Gravel and sand communities
. Mixed sediment communities
The Fal and Helford Management scheme clearly states in the section Subtidal sandbanks
that in order to meet the above objectives, relevant and competent authorities are advised to
manage activities within their remit such that they do not result in
removal and/or smothering
physical damage resulting from siltation, abrasion and/or selective extraction
.
increased synthetic and/or non-synthetic toxic contamination
nutrient and/or organic enrichment
*
. increases in turbidity
The assessment criteria for the favourable condition of the Maerl bed communities (Table 5
of the Fal and Helford Management scheme) is set out in the attached Table
While we would agree that the proposed plan to replace the maerl is likely to maintain the
extent criteria we would argue that the impact of the dredge and replace will adversely
impact both the distribution of maerl bed communities and the species composition of maerl
bed communities attributes, contrary to the conservation objectives for the site, as set out

Food and Environmental Protection Act 1985 / Coast Protection Act - Application for
Capital Dredge and replacement of maerl, Falmouth Harbour
Thank you for your letter dated 19 August, received 21 August, together with the CD containing
the Environmental Statement regarding the proposed dredge and repla
deposits from Falmouth Harbour.
cement of maerl
We can confirm that the proposed dredge and deposition site is located within the boundary
of the Fal / Helford SAC, an area designated as a European site of conservation importance
under the provision of the Conservation (Natural Habitats &c.) Reguiations, 1994
can confirm that, following an appraisal of the evidence presented in the extensive
documentation supplied by Royal Haskonning in support of this proposed development, Natural
England considers that the proposal is likely to have a significant effect on the designated
features of the SAC and therefore requires an appropriate assessment. Natural England is
of the_ view that there is_sufficient information_contained within the Environmental
Statement for Marine & Fisheries Agency to undertake an Appropriate Assessmen
the Conservation (Natural Habitats &c) Regulations 1994
t under
The dredge area is largely composed of maerl habitat, listed as a sub-feature of Subtidal
Sandbanks that forms part of the SAC designation
The following is included from the Fal & Helford SAC Management Document
Maerl beds are composed of accumulations of living and dead unattached coralline
algae. Live maerl is pink and is found in the largest quantities in England and Wales on
St. Mawes Bank and offers shelter to a large number of other species of plants and
animals. There are also extensive areas of dead maeri and these sediments are also
species rich and provide an important habitat for deep burrowing species, attached
seaweed and large areas of brittle stars
The proposed dredge seeks to remove up to 60,000 cubic meters of predominantly maerl
sediment and use this to "recreate" maeri habitat in polygons 17, 18, 20 & 21 (as identified in
Figure 2-3 of the Environmental Statement). This area was surveyed by Seastar (Axelsson et
al. 2008) who reported on a number of survey stations. The relevant stations from the Seastar
survey Characterised the various polygons as being composed of between 50 and 80+% dead
maerl with between 1 and 10% live maerl
Natural England have specific concerns regarding this plan namely
Destruction of the maerl matrix
It is planned to remove the maerl sediment by use of a backhoe dredge, store the material on
barge, over dredge the non maerl material to ensure that the required depth of channel is
reached, then replace the maerl sediment by way of backhoe or hose. Natural England believe
that the action of maerl sediment removał, storage and replacement will break up the sediment
matrix, increase the level of fine material thus altering the overall sediment composition, and
significantly alter the character of the sediment matrix
. IE, the action of dredging the maerl
ediment will destroy the matrix that comprises the valuable habitat listed as a sub feature of
the SAC designation. It will also destroy the small amount of live maerl up to 10% currently
recorded on the sediment surface. It has been suggested (Hall-Spencer, 2009) that a
maerl both within the dredge area and across a 20m zone around the dredge area will die a
result of the dredging. This in itself constitutes a major adverse impact.
Predicted rates of sedimentation
The proposed sites for placement of maerl (polygons 17,1820 & 21) are all on the eastern
edge of the channel. The work done by HR Wallingford (Appendix A of the Environmental
Statement) on the predicted sediment movement post dredging. Figure 6.6 of that report give
the predicted annual sand infill across the whole of the proposed channel. Polygons 17 & 21
to experience up to 1m of sediment erosion while polygons 18 & 20 are predicted
to experience up to 1m of sediment deposition. This large amount of sediment movement is
likely to reduce any "beneficia" replacement of maerl and hinder further the recovery of the
sediment matrix
These changes in the sediment regime have been identified by Hali-Spencer as impeding the
recovery of both the
live maerl and the maerl sediment matrix with its associated biodiversity
Over optimistic rates of recovery
Natural England believe that the estimated rate of recovery of the habitat of between 2-5 years
as stated in the Environmental Statement is over optimistic.
in the maerl recovery note from Royal Haskoning prepared in 2008, one of the bases for the
expected recovery rates is from a paper from Phua et al

The proposals for the dredge in Falmouth harbour are of a much greater magnitude and scale
than previous documented research, which has considered activities on maerl habitats that
have impacted the surface layers of maerl. The proposed dredge involves a far gr
impact than anything that has been studied previously. Therefore it is likely that there will be a
much greater impact on the habitat, and previous studies do not enable sufficient certainty on
the potential recovery of habitat.
eater physical
The review of the potential for maert recovery undertaken by Jason Hall Spencer, on behalf of
Royal Haskonning, places further doubt on the assessment of recovery of 2-5 years stated in
the Environmental Statement. The report highlights the impact
between dredging and redeployment on the infauna. Any infauna would be ki
of storing the maerl on a barge
lled by the
dredging and storage. These organisms would then begin to decompose causing the maerl
deposits to become anoxic, hindering any recovery
tn summarising the likely recovery rates, Hall-Spencer states that the maerl will not recover in
thi ted 2-5 years and further states "...I would not expect a mature maerl community to
becuie established for 20-50 years, if at al.
On the basis of the above information, Natural England advises that the proposed dredge and
deposition would lead to an adverse impact on the Sandbank features of the Fal and Helford
SAC, and as such consent cannot be granted without following the process outlined in the
Conservation (Natural Habitats &c.) Regulations, 1994.
If, after having carried out an Appropriate Assessment, you are minded to issue the FEPA
licence, we request the chance to comment on the conclusions of that Assessment, prior to the
icence being issued.
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or comments on any of the
points raised in this response.

Dear Nicola,
Port of Falmouth Development Initiative
Thank you for your letter dated 25th November giving your response to my letter to the Marine and
Fisheries Agency in which set out Natural England's views of the proposed dredge and replacement of
maerl sediments. Thank you also for including a copy of the briefing document dated 25h November sent
to Mark Sampson & Mike Reynolds
We have been discussing the issues you raise in your letter and our promise of further advice regarding
what would constitute a significant loss of maerl habitat and have the following advice
Under article 6.2 of the 1992 Habitats Directive there is a duty to "Avoid deterioration of habitats and
significant disturbance." You have raised the question as to what constitutes a significant disturbance to
the maerl sub-feature of the Fal & Helford SAC. In your letter, based on the mapping work undertaken by
yourself and Harriet Knowles, you estimate that the dredging will impact 2% of the total maerl present
within the SAC. In determining the likely significant impact of a plan or project on the integrity of a site or
feature of a site, the ECJ 7/9/04 Ruling on the Waddenzee Cockle Fishing (The Waddenzee Ruling)
stated that a likeliness to impact should be determined as requiring an
cannot be excluded, on the basis of objective information, that it will have a significant effect on the site
if it
As part of the Integrity test the precautionary principle in the Conservation (Natural Habitats &c)
Regulations 1994 (The Habs. Regs.) says that for the regulator to ensure there would be no harm, it can
only issue consent "only after having ascertained that the plan or project will not adversely affect the
integrity of the European site." This is further backed by the statement that the Competent Authority
should be "certain" about the lack of adverse effects
The problem we have in determining extent of the possible adverse impact of the proposed dredge and
replacement of the maerl sediment matrix is there have been no previous attempts at such a project
Given this lack of data on this type of operation, the ambiguity regarding the recovery rate and the
identified habitat loss, it must be concluded that the proposed plan could lead to an adverse impact on
the integrity of the SAC. Furthermore, it is not possible to allocate a number to what percentage of loss /
area impacted could be considered as acceptable and not likely to have an adverse impact on the
integrity of the SAGC
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or require further information

Food and Environmental Protection Act 1985 / Coast Protection Act - Application for
Capital Dredge and replacement of maerl, Falmouth Harbour
Thank you for your letter dated 19 August, received 21 August, together with the CD containing
the Environmental Statement regarding the proposed dredge and repla
deposits from Falmouth Harbour.
cement of maerl
We can confirm that the proposed dredge and deposition site is located within the boundary
of the Fal / Helford SAC, an area designated as a European site of conservation importance
under the provision of the Conservation (Natural Habitats &c.) Reguiations, 1994
can confirm that, following an appraisal of the evidence presented in the extensive
documentation supplied by Royal Haskonning in support of this proposed development, Natural
England considers that the proposal is likely to have a significant effect on the designated
features of the SAC and therefore requires an appropriate assessment. Natural England is
of the_ view that there is_sufficient information_contained within the Environmental
Statement for Marine & Fisheries Agency to undertake an Appropriate Assessmen
the Conservation (Natural Habitats &c) Regulations 1994
t under
The dredge area is largely composed of maerl habitat, listed as a sub-feature of Subtidal
Sandbanks that forms part of the SAC designation
The following is included from the Fal & Helford SAC Management Document
Maerl beds are composed of accumulations of living and dead unattached coralline
algae. Live maerl is pink and is found in the largest quantities in England and Wales on
St. Mawes Bank and offers shelter to a large number of other species of plants and
animals. There are also extensive areas of dead maeri and these sediments are also
species rich and provide an important habitat for deep burrowing species, attached
seaweed and large areas of brittle stars
The proposed dredge seeks to remove up to 60,000 cubic meters of predominantly maerl
sediment and use this to "recreate" maeri habitat in polygons 17, 18, 20 & 21 (as identified in
Figure 2-3 of the Environmental Statement). This area was surveyed by Seastar (Axelsson et
al. 2008) who reported on a number of survey stations. The relevant stations from the Seastar
survey Characterised the various polygons as being composed of between 50 and 80+% dead
maerl with between 1 and 10% live maerl
Natural England have specific concerns regarding this plan namely
Destruction of the maerl matrix
It is planned to remove the maerl sediment by use of a backhoe dredge, store the material on
barge, over dredge the non maerl material to ensure that the required depth of channel is
reached, then replace the maerl sediment by way of backhoe or hose. Natural England believe
that the action of maerl sediment removał, storage and replacement will break up the sediment
matrix, increase the level of fine material thus altering the overall sediment composition, and
significantly alter the character of the sediment matrix
. IE, the action of dredging the maerl
ediment will destroy the matrix that comprises the valuable habitat listed as a sub feature of
the SAC designation. It will also destroy the small amount of live maerl up to 10% currently
recorded on the sediment surface. It has been suggested (Hall-Spencer, 2009) that a
maerl both within the dredge area and across a 20m zone around the dredge area will die a
result of the dredging. This in itself constitutes a major adverse impact.
Predicted rates of sedimentation
The proposed sites for placement of maerl (polygons 17,1820 & 21) are all on the eastern
edge of the channel. The work done by HR Wallingford (Appendix A of the Environmental
Statement) on the predicted sediment movement post dredging. Figure 6.6 of that report give
the predicted annual sand infill across the whole of the proposed channel. Polygons 17 & 21
to experience up to 1m of sediment erosion while polygons 18 & 20 are predicted
to experience up to 1m of sediment deposition. This large amount of sediment movement is
likely to reduce any "beneficia" replacement of maerl and hinder further the recovery of the
sediment matrix
These changes in the sediment regime have been identified by Hali-Spencer as impeding the
recovery of both the
live maerl and the maerl sediment matrix with its associated biodiversity
Over optimistic rates of recovery
Natural England believe that the estimated rate of recovery of the habitat of between 2-5 years
as stated in the Environmental Statement is over optimistic.
in the maerl recovery note from Royal Haskoning prepared in 2008, one of the bases for the
expected recovery rates is from a paper from Phua et al

The proposals for the dredge in Falmouth harbour are of a much greater magnitude and scale
than previous documented research, which has considered activities on maerl habitats that
have impacted the surface layers of maerl. The proposed dredge involves a far gr
impact than anything that has been studied previously. Therefore it is likely that there will be a
much greater impact on the habitat, and previous studies do not enable sufficient certainty on
the potential recovery of habitat.
eater physical
The review of the potential for maert recovery undertaken by Jason Hall Spencer, on behalf of
Royal Haskonning, places further doubt on the assessment of recovery of 2-5 years stated in
the Environmental Statement. The report highlights the impact
between dredging and redeployment on the infauna. Any infauna would be ki
of storing the maerl on a barge
lled by the
dredging and storage. These organisms would then begin to decompose causing the maerl
deposits to become anoxic, hindering any recovery
tn summarising the likely recovery rates, Hall-Spencer states that the maerl will not recover in
thi ted 2-5 years and further states "...I would not expect a mature maerl community to
becuie established for 20-50 years, if at al.
On the basis of the above information, Natural England advises that the proposed dredge and
deposition would lead to an adverse impact on the Sandbank features of the Fal and Helford
SAC, and as such consent cannot be granted without following the process outlined in the
Conservation (Natural Habitats &c.) Regulations, 1994.
If, after having carried out an Appropriate Assessment, you are minded to issue the FEPA
licence, we request the chance to comment on the conclusions of that Assessment, prior to the
icence being issued.
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or comments on any of the
points raised in this response.

Dear Nicola,
Port of Falmouth Development Initiative
Thank you for your letter dated 25th November giving your response to my letter to the Marine and
Fisheries Agency in which set out Natural England's views of the proposed dredge and replacement of
maerl sediments. Thank you also for including a copy of the briefing document dated 25h November sent
to Mark Sampson & Mike Reynolds
We have been discussing the issues you raise in your letter and our promise of further advice regarding
what would constitute a significant loss of maerl habitat and have the following advice
Under article 6.2 of the 1992 Habitats Directive there is a duty to "Avoid deterioration of habitats and
significant disturbance." You have raised the question as to what constitutes a significant disturbance to
the maerl sub-feature of the Fal & Helford SAC. In your letter, based on the mapping work undertaken by
yourself and Harriet Knowles, you estimate that the dredging will impact 2% of the total maerl present
within the SAC. In determining the likely significant impact of a plan or project on the integrity of a site or
feature of a site, the ECJ 7/9/04 Ruling on the Waddenzee Cockle Fishing (The Waddenzee Ruling)
stated that a likeliness to impact should be determined as requiring an
cannot be excluded, on the basis of objective information, that it will have a significant effect on the site
if it
As part of the Integrity test the precautionary principle in the Conservation (Natural Habitats &c)
Regulations 1994 (The Habs. Regs.) says that for the regulator to ensure there would be no harm, it can
only issue consent "only after having ascertained that the plan or project will not adversely affect the
integrity of the European site." This is further backed by the statement that the Competent Authority
should be "certain" about the lack of adverse effects
The problem we have in determining extent of the possible adverse impact of the proposed dredge and
replacement of the maerl sediment matrix is there have been no previous attempts at such a project
Given this lack of data on this type of operation, the ambiguity regarding the recovery rate and the
identified habitat loss, it must be concluded that the proposed plan could lead to an adverse impact on
the integrity of the SAC. Furthermore, it is not possible to allocate a number to what percentage of loss /
area impacted could be considered as acceptable and not likely to have an adverse impact on the
integrity of the SAGC
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or require further information

Application for the disposal of capital dredged material from Falmouth Harbour, Falmouth,
Cornwall: maerl disposal and seabed mitigation
In response to the above application for the re-use of maerl as a substrate within the footprint of
the planned overall dredge, we do not feel that we have the detailed knowledge of the feasibility
of this methodology to comment on its suitability as a mitigation measure.
However, as a Sea Fisheries Committee and a relevant authority for this SAC, we were closely
involved in previous casework relating to the perceived impact of scalloping on maerl habitats in
Falmouth Bay, which led to the banning of towed gear in this area. Mitigation measures
proposed by CSFC in conjunction with the owners of the affected scalloping vessels were deemed
to be insufficient to enable scalloping to continue, despite the low levels of fishing effort
proposed or the relatively small areas affected. The dredging and disposal of 60 000 m of maerl
habitat is at an altogether different scale and we find it difficult to understand how this proposal
could adequately mitigate for the impact of the overall dredging proposal on the condition of the
conservation features of this SAC.

l. am writing to express our concerns over. the impact of the volume of the proposed capita!
dredge disposal on the spcil disposal site and surrounding area within Falmouth Bay and the
potential Implications for fisheries in the vicinity of the site. As this site is located outside the
boundary of the Fa Helford SAC and consequently of no direct concern to Natural England, It
appears to have been given only limited consideration within the Environmental Statement,
which in our view is disproportionate to the scale of the proposed activity.
The proposed deposition on the existing spoil ground within a 6 month period represents a six
fold increase in the overall volumes deposited on this site since its inception and will alter the
topography of the entire 100 Ha area by up to 50cm, in addition to the albeit lower levels of
accretion within 800m of the boundary of the spail ground. The spoil disposal site and the
surrounding areas are, as noted within the ES, are utilised by commerclal vessels deploying nets,
pots and trawls, in addition to recreational angling vessels. Whilst the fish species targeted may
be able to avoid smothering, edible crabs are targeted here and are more likely, as referenced in
section 11.4.8., to be adversely affected by smothering particularly if this involved multiple
depositon events as per the method statement stated for this project. We feel that the residual
adverse impact is likely to be more than minor, as stated in the ES.
We note that in section 12.4.1. that Falmouth Harbour Commissioners has the jurisdiction to
advise the cessation of fishing activity within the new navigational channel, the saling route to
the disposal slte and in the disposal slte itself. Whilst this may avoid conflict with fishing activity
and damage to fishing gear, it will result in the displacement of the vessels using these areas
Falmouth Bay is extensively fished by a variety of vessels and any displacement of vessels or gear
will have a knock-on effect on fishing actlvity in other areas. Any proposals of this nature must be

Section 25.2 mentions a monitoring plan for the disposal site, n which it is stated that a.
Baseline may need to be established prior to the disposal activities'. Baseline surveys of benthic
communities should be undertaken as matter of course as it will n be possible to assess

associated with the dredge spoil, a concern highlighted by fishermen working in this area, as this
has the potential to restrict the deployment of fishing gear in the future once the disposal
activities have ceased.

Re: Food & Environmental Protection Act 1985 Part I
Application for the disposal of capital dredged material from Falmouth Harbour,
Falmouth, Cornwall
Further to my letter of 27 October 2009 and a meeting yesterday with the applicants and their
representatives, I would like to make the following comments regarding this application.
1. We wish to be consulted on the scope and detail of the disposal site monitoring and mitigation
package to be developed between the applicant, their contractors, Natural England, Environment
Agency and CEFAS, if the FEPA license is granted. In particular, we would expect to see a baseline
survey of the disposal ground undertaken prior to the disposal operation commencing in order to
assess the impacts of the vast increase in the volumes of spoil to be placed there. We have not
seen any data regarding eh existing monitoring of this disposal site.
2. We also have concerns regarding the potential for elevated cadmium levels in the flesh of edible
crabs, which is causing marketing issues in parts of Europe, so we would like sampling for cadmium
in this species to be included in the above monitoring package. We do understand from the
applicant that CEFAS has requested additional testing of sediments from the proposed dredging
sites in order to ensure that the analyses are current.
3. We reiterate the need, as recognised in the Environmental Statement and by the applicant in our
meeting yesterday, for proactive and detailed liaison to be undertaken with the fishing industry and
other relevant marine users leading up to and during the dredging period, to avoid conflict with their
activities and to facilitate the dredging process.
4. In conclusion, we do not object to the above FEPA application, provided that points 1-3 are
addressed in the associated licence conditions or through agreement with the applicant

Dear Olayinka
APPLICATION FOR THE DISPOSAL OF DREDGED MATERIAL FROM
FALMOUTH HARBOUR
Thank you for referring the above application which was received on 21st August
2009
We have no objections to the proposal, but wish to make the following comments.
No dredged waste can come ashore without the appropriate Environmentàl Permits
or Consents being in place. No dredged waste can be deposited above the MHWS
without the appropriate permits being in place.
The dredging activity should not detrimentally impact designated shellfish beds in the
Fal Estuary. Mitigation and/or compensation may be required if impacts are
unavoidable. The dredging activity should not detrimentary impact the commercial
prawn fishery in the Estuary. Mitigation and or compensation may be required if the
impacts are unavoidable.
The full extent of the oyster and prawn fishery should be obtained by the applicant
discussing with the fisherman directly. Any maps previously supplied by the Agency
are indicative only.
Should dredged material come ashore for treatment for treatment we will seek
through our role as a statutory under the planning legislation, that in accordance with
the Planning Policy Statement 23, contamination that may be present within the land
used for such treatment is subject to assessment and then remediated where such

We have concerns regarding the potential impacts of the capital dredge on the
marine ecology. The potential impacts of dredge plooms on subtidal eel grass
(Zostera sp) beds have not been considered in the report. Zostera beds are listed as
priority habitat under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan, 1994. FRB recommends that
an adequate monitoring programme is set up to ensure no net loss of habitat, and
the quality of the existing habitat is protected from potential damage by the dredgin-
There is Environment Agency data showing the presence of Couch's Goby (Gobius
couchi) and seahorse Hippocampus spp. Both these protected species have been
caught during routine WFD monitoring surveys using seine netting and beam
trawling within the Carrick Roads. These species could be impacted by the dredging
We also have concerns over the proposed redeposition site for the maerl deposits.
The Hydrodynamic study concludes "Waves from offshore are more affected by the
dredging, with reflections from the dredged channel causing a decrease in wave
height within the dredged channel, and increases in the basin to the east of Western
Wharf". The proposed location and increase in wave action could make the proposed
maerl redeposition site vulnerable to wave erosion and sediment deposition onto the
maerl habitat
Natural England is the responsible authority for the proposed dredging site, which
lies within the Fal & Helford SAC. Natural England must be satisfied that the
redeposition of the maerl deposits post-dredging is a viable form of habitat
mitigation. Maerl beds are listed as priority habitat under the UK Biodiversity Action
Plan, 1994. Natural England are the lead organisation for protecting maerl habitat
under UK BAP, which recommends that there should be no net loss of habitat, and
the quality of the existing resource must be protected. Therefore any loss and impact
to BAP habitat is contrary to BAP targets.

Dear Elaine
APPLICATION FOR THE DISPOSAL OF CAPITAL DREDGED MATERIAL FROM
FALMOUTH DOCKS
I refer to Yinka's email, regarding the above, which was received on the 19th January
2010.
The report by Dr Hal-Spencer is very well written and provides a balanced opinion
from an expert independent witness on the potential effects of dredging and
translocating the mearl habitat.
The report supports the theory stated in the Environment Statement, produced by
Royal Haskoning, that the maerl would be expected to recolonise with many of the
small and abundant species that characterise the maerl habitat, but it predicts that
this would take 20-50 years to establish rather than the 2-5 years stated in the ES
Although it is reassuring that the maerl beds are likely to re-establish, it is important
to determine how long it will take for the reduced quality habitat to return to SAC
value as the integrity of the SAC must not be compromised by this proposal
Under the Habitat Regulations it is within our duties for nature conservation that we
must assess any plans or projects that are likely to.have a significant effect on the
integrity of the designated ecological interest features within SACs for their effects.
Natural England, as the competent authority for the Habitats Directive Regulations,
need to be satisfied that the proposed mitigation measures are suitable and viable
and can only permit them if the applicant can show that they will have no adverse
effect ón the integrity of the site
In the report Dr Hall-Spencer makes some additional recommendations/comments
which we feel that it is important to consider before any decisions can be made

1. Given that no data exists on the recovery of maerl beds that have been
dredged and relocated FRB welcome carrying out a trial. It is vital to
determine the likelihood of the maerl re-establishing and surviving in its new
locations through an experimental trial so an informed decision can be made.
2. With the danger of any relocated maerl becoming smothered and dying we
recommend that alternative sites are found to place the mearl which reduce
this risk and encourage re-establishment of the habitat. In order for this
proposal to be acceptable the maerl beds that will be removed by the
dredging must be replaced with habitat of similar quality and at least given the
best opportunity to establish and recolonise
3. The percentage and distribution of maerl within the SAC must be determined
along with the area that will be removed by the dredging as the relocated
habitat must replace the area that will be lost. In order to preserve and
maintain the integrity of the SAC there must be no net loss of maerl bed
habitat.

Dear Elaine
APPLICATION FOR THE DISPOSAL OF CAPITAL DREDGED MATERIAL FROM
FALMOUTH DOCKS
refer to the above application and my response dated 23rd October 2010, additional
information has been received from Haskoning UK Ltd and we can comment as
follows.
Undated Sheet of Comments.
1. and 2. (also relates to Comments 2. and 4. of the letter dated 23rd October)
It was recognised in the original comments that the effects of wind are time-varying
and mostly related to the near-surface waters. It is also recognised that much of the
impact arising from the sediment disturbance will tend to be near the sea bed
However, given the predicted sediment plume, coupled with the weak tidal currents,
the 7 month duration of the dredging operations, and the present low turbidity of the
waters in the Roads, there remain concerns over the potential impact of the
dredging operations on the turbidity of the water over the eelgrass beds, shellfish
beds and live maerl in the lower Carrick Roads from wind-driven currents.
3. and 4. It is understood that under the Habitats Directive work, there is a proposal
to address the extent of live and dead maerl in the SAC and the proportion which
would be impacted by the proposed dredging works. This should also provide
relevant information in relation to the WFD requirements, and is what was requested
in the original comments.
It is therefore requested that this information is also provided to the EA
5. We note the comments on the preparation of a monitoring plan.

Dear Olayinka
APPLICATION FOR THE DISPOSAL OF DREDGED MATERIAL FROM
FALMOUTH HARBOUR
Thank you for referring the above application which was received on 21st August
2009
We have no objections to the proposal, but wish to make the following comments.
No dredged waste can come ashore without the appropriate Environmentàl Permits
or Consents being in place. No dredged waste can be deposited above the MHWS
without the appropriate permits being in place.
The dredging activity should not detrimentally impact designated shellfish beds in the
Fal Estuary. Mitigation and/or compensation may be required if impacts are
unavoidable. The dredging activity should not detrimentary impact the commercial
prawn fishery in the Estuary. Mitigation and or compensation may be required if the
impacts are unavoidable.
The full extent of the oyster and prawn fishery should be obtained by the applicant
discussing with the fisherman directly. Any maps previously supplied by the Agency
are indicative only.
Should dredged material come ashore for treatment for treatment we will seek
through our role as a statutory under the planning legislation, that in accordance with
the Planning Policy Statement 23, contamination that may be present within the land
used for such treatment is subject to assessment and then remediated where such
assessment shows this is necessary

Dear Mr Omidire
Application for the construction of a new quay infrastructure to connect
Queens Wharf and the Northern Wharf
Thank you for your letter dated 19th August 2009 regarding the above.
Please find below my comments regarding this application.
Protection of the Marine Environment
This application is to replace an existing quay wall with a more modern, safer and fit
for purpose structure. Provided that any works are undertaken in order to minimise
any silt movement then I do not envisage any problems.
Additionally, it is important to ensure that any debris during the demolition phase is
not left in the marine environment but taken ashore and correctly disposed of. Indeed
the current structure, in its dilapidated condition in places, is likely to be more of a
danger to the marine environment.
Prevention of interference with other legitimate uses of the sea
Again, this application is to replace existing quay walls and I do not consider that
there will be any interference with other legitimate users of the sea unless it was of a
very short duration during the construction phase.
Minimisation of noise and nuisance
This can be managed by introducing appropriate times to undertake the works i.e. no
noisy work to take place during the late night/early mornings etc.

Potential impacts on navigation, such as obstruction or endangerment
Again, this should be managed effectively by ensuring that navigation is not
endangered. Obviously there should be provision for temporary navigation marks if
considered to be required, together with adequate warnings for mariners where
necessary
The need for special lighting or markings
Please see above. In addition, Trinity House will no doubt require some form of
permanent navigation mark/light to be placed on this new quay on completion of the
works
Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of any further assistance in this

Dear Olayinka
FOOD AND ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION ACT 1985 Part I
COAST PROTECTION ACT: SECTION 34
APPLICATION FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW QUAY INFRASTRUCTURE
TO CONNECT QUEEN'S WHARF AND THE NORTHERN WHARF
Thank you for your letter dated 19 August 2009 in which you invited our views on the
potential impact of the above proposed works on the interests of navigation.
The proposal has been examined by staff of the Navigation Safety Branch and it can
be noted that the proposed works are unlikely to have an adverse impact, with
regards to safety of navigation, provided:
A copy of this consent must be given to each contractor appointed to carry out
part or all of 'the works' in order that they are clear about the extent of
the works' for which consent has been given and the conditions that are
attached to the consent
The Consent Holder should ensure suitable bunding, storage facilities are
employed to prevent the release of fuel õils, lubricating fluids associated with
the plant and equipment into the marine environment.
The ConsentHolder should ensure the local mariner's and fishermen's
organisations are notified.
2
3
The Consent Holder should notify the UK Hydrographic Office to permit the
promulgation of maritime safety information and updating of nautical
publications
4
If in the opinion of the Secretary of State the assistance of a Government
Department, including the broadcast of navigational warnings, is required in
connection with the works or to deal with any emergency arising from the
failure to mark and light the works as required by the consent or to maintain

the works in good order or from the drifting or wreck of the works, the owner of
the works shall be liable for any expense incurred in securing such assistance.
Officers of the MCA, or any other person authorised by the Secretary of State,
should be permitted to inspect the works at any reasonable time
6.
The site is within port limits and the responsible local navigation authority,
Falmouth Harbour Commissioners, may wish to issue local warnings to alert
those navigating in the vicinity to the presence of the works during the
construction. Additionally, they may need to review their Port Marine Safety
Code risk assessments.,
7.
The matter is an issue for the local harbour authority with conservancy
responsibilities. They have the responsibility within their port limits for ensuring
their harbour is fit for use, by, for example, not permitting the spoil to foul
navigable channels thus assuring the safety of navigation.
8
The works should be marked and lighted in accordance with the requirements
of the General Lighthouse Authority in this case Trinity House Lighthouse
Service
9.
If these conditions are met I arn able to advise you that the Maritime and Coastguard
Agency (MCA) has no objection to consent being granted provided that measures are
also taken to ensure that details of the proposed works are promulgated to maritime
users through notice to mariners and/or navigational warnings.
Please note, however, that a charge will be levied on the developers, by MCA, for
the transmission of maritime safety information, via Navtex or Coastguard VHF radio
network, in respect of the proposed works. Agreement by the developers to pay any
such charges should, ideally, be a condition of the consent if they are likely to be
used.

Dear Secretary of State
RE PORT OF FALMOUTH DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE FAL & HELFORD
SAC - EC HABITATS DIRECTIVE (92143/EEC)
I am writing to object to the Port of Falmouth Development Initiative (PFDI), as
jointly proposed by Falmouth Harbour Commissioners (FHC) and the
Falmouth Docks and Engineering Company (FDEC). I live in Falmouth and
grew up in the area. My family has strong maritime connections with Falmouth
going back at least four generations (including the Royal and Merchant Navies
and the Coastguard Service). I am a professional marine biologist with 20
years post-graduate training and experience. This includes two years work as
a Marine Conservation Officer for English Nature in Cornwall, in which time
my main area of responsibility was the Fal & Helford Special Area of
Conservation (SAC). As well as being a marine biologist I am also a part-time
commercial scallop diver (owner/skipper of the under 10m fishing vessel
'Morvran' FH745). The area that will be affected by the PFDI includes an
important area where I dive for scallops
wwemain objection to the PEDlis that.it wil have an adverse effect on the
integrity of the subtidal sandbank feature of the Fal & Helford SAC, particularly
its maerl communities. In my opinion, the impacts created by the PFDI alone
would be sufficient to adversely affect the integrity of this feature. The case
against consent for the PFDI increases when this proposal is considered 'in
combination' (sensu Article 6-3 of the Habitats Directive) with the various
other human activities that have also significantly impacted this feature in
recent history. Most of these other activities were not subject to an appropriate
assessment and as such represent prima facie breaches of Article 6-3 of the
Habitats Directive. Nor in most cases was there any subsequent attempt to
measure the actual impacts of these activities via monitoring. Several of these
failures of SAC management are attributable to FHC, one of the proponents of
the PFDI. FHC's most notable managerial failures have been in relation to (i)
commercial extraction of maerl sand (for use as an agricultural soil
conditioner), (ii) ship anchoring and (ii) proliferation of moorings
A further problem for the PFDI proposal is that the conservation status of the
subtidal sandbank feature was not assessed within the first 6-year reporting
phase for this site', and, as far as I am aware, it has still not been assessed
This represents a further prima facie breach of the Habitats Directive (in this
case in respect of Article 17-3)
Thus, the context for the PFDI is a Natura 2000 site that has been subject to
numerous activities that are likely to have impacted its conservation status,
but which were not appropriately assessed before they occurred and whose
subsequent impacts were not determined via monitoring. This critical
contextual information is not reported in the PFDI Environmental Statement
Uncertainty about the current conservation status of the subtidal sandbank
feature of the Fal & Helford SAC necessitates a high level of precaution when
concluding as to the effects of the PFDl. As you'll be aware, in order to comply
with the Habitats Directive, this precaution must be exercised in favour of the
environment.
I understand that Natural England (NE) considers that consent for the PFDI
ultimately won't hinge on the likelihood of an adverse effect on the integrity of
the SAC (as they consider that this to be effectively inconvertible), but on
whether the PFDl 'must [J be carried out for imperative reasons of overriding
public interest" in spite of its adverse effects (i.e. consent under Article 6-4 of
the Habitats Directive). As you will be aware, consent on grounds of
imperative reasons of overriding public interest (IROPI) requires that the
following criteria must be satisfied
1. there is no satisfactory alternative;
Williams, J.M., ed. 2006. Common Standards Monitoring for Designated Sites: First Six Year Report. Peterborough,
JNCC
2. there are imperative reasons of overriding public interest relating to
human health, public safety or benefits of primary importance to the
environment or other imperative socio-economic reasons sufficient to
override the harm to the site; and
3. compensatory measures are provided to ensure that the overall
coherence of Natura 2000 is protected (interpreted by NE to mean that
"the action authorised will not be detrimental to the maintenance of the
population of the species concerned at a favourable conservation
status in their natural range")
Even if one accepts that there is no satisfactory alternative to the PFDI (which
I do not), I put it to you that this plan is not of sufficient public importance to
override the harm it would cause to the site. Nor, I contend, would it be
possible to secure sufticlent ecological compensation of the right kind to
maintain the overall coherence of the Natura 2000 network. For these reasons
I believe that the PFDI should not be consented.
If the PFDI is consented I will feel compelled to report the UK Government to
the EC for breach of the Habitats Directive in relation to this plan. Werel
obliged to make this complaint then, as well as drawing the commission's
attention to my specific concerns about the PFDI, I would also inform them of
the numerous other instances where management of the Fal & Helford SAC
appears to have been in breach of the Habitats Directive to the detriment of
the site
A more-detailed explanation of my concerns about the PFDI and its
managerial and environmental context is provided in the following addendum

ADDENDUM TO CONSULTATION RESPONSE RE THE PORT OF
FALMOUTH DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE: FAL & HELFORD SAC - EC
HABITATS DIRECTIVE (92/43/EEC)
Dr MG Hoskin, 16 September 2009
In the preceding letter, I objected to the PFDI on the following grounds:
when considered alone, the PFDI wil have an adverse effect on the
integrity of the subtidal sandbank feature of the Fal & Helford SAC
2. the effect of the PFDI will be additional to several other adverse effects
on the integrity of the subtidal sandbank feature of the Fal & Helford
SAC that have already occurred (many of which constitute present
prima facie breaches of the Habitats Directive);
3. the conservation status of the subtidal sandbank feature of the Fal &
Helford SAC was not assessed within the first six-year reporting phase
for the site and has still not been assessed;
4. the PFDI is not of sufficient public importance to override the harm it is
likely to do to the Fal & Helford SAC alone and in combination; and
itwill not be possible to secure compensation to maintain the species
that will be affected by the PFDI at a favourable conservation status in
their natural range (and thus maintain the overall coherence of the
Natura 2000 Network).
will now address each of these concerns in more detail
1. When considered alone, the PFDI will have an adverse effect on
the integrity of the subtidal sandbank feature of the Fal & Helford SAC
The environmental statement (ES) for the PFDI concludes that it will have 'no
long term effect on the integrity of the SAC". Adverse effects are expected to
be only temporary "until mitigation replaces the lost habitat and a longer term

change in community types until recolonisation occurs [sicj]". In my opinion,
this is simply wishful thinking with next to no scientific credibility.
The European Commission has set a very high scientific standard for
appropriate assessments and also requires a highly precautionary
interpretation of likely significant effects. This was clarified as follows in the
2004 ECJ ruling on the Waddenzee Cockle Fishery
"...an appropriate assessment implies that prior to the approval of a
plan or project all aspects which can affect the site's conservation objectives
must be identified using the 'best scientificknowledceinthe_field'. The
competent authorities are to authorise activities 'onlyif_they_have made
certain it will not adversely affect the integrity of that site. That is the case
where no reasonable scientific doubt remains as to the absence of such
effects'
In my opinion, the science on display in the ES is of a very poor standard and
there is enormous scope for 'scientific doubt about its headline conclusion
that the PFDI will have "no long term effect on the integrity of the SAC". I
believe that the environmental consultants responsible, Royal Haskonin
RH), were only able to report this conclusion (i) by vastly underestimating the
severity of the immediate impacts and (ii) by vastlyoverestimatingtherate
and extent of recovery in impacted areas and the likely efficacy of the
roposed mitigation measures
My overall impression of the assessment of likely effects on the SAC was that
it was based on poor quality, inconclusive information that was consistently
and systematically interpreted in favour of the proposal and against the
interests of the SAC. now endeavour to substantiate this view by
reference to the various claims in the ES to have detected and characterised
recovery of maerl habitats in parts of the Fal & Helford SAC that were once
subject to commercial maerl extraction

it was based on poor quality, inconclusive information that was consistently
and systematically interpreted in favour of the proposal and against the
interests of the SAC. now endeavour to substantiate this view by
reference to the various claims in the ES to have detected and characterised
recovery of maerl habitats in parts of the Fal & Helford SAC that were once
subject to commercial maerl extraction

Dear Mark
Re: Port of Falmouth Development Initiative
Thank you for your letter of the 7h December regarding the establishment of the
current position. We would like to confirm that, in general, the MMO and the Port of
Falmouth have agreed a way forward on a scientific trial to resolve environmental
issues around development of the harbour. A decision on your marine licence
application will follow if the trial succeeds. If this application were successful it is
anticipated that development could proceed in early 2013
The MMO has agreed that a scientific trial could be undertaken with the aim of
conclusively establishing the impact and recovery associated with the translocation
of maerl habitat, provided such a trial represents the best available evidence and
that the licensing of the trial itself is successful. Upon this basis a detailed trial
methodology is to be put forward by the applicants and approved by the MMO
It has been established by preliminary survey that live maerl is present in the
channel. The trial site must therefore be selected to allow the impact of translocation
on live maerl to be established
An Independent Scientific Advisory Panel (ISAP) comprised of members approved of
by the applicants, the MMO, and Natural England has been established and is being
funded by the MMO. The aim of establishing an ISAP is to provide independent
scientific knowledge, advice and judgement to assist the MMO in ensuring that the
trial is scientifically robust and thus produces credible results and conclusions. Their
role is not to undertake scientific analysis, or identify mitigation options, but to
provide an additional check on the scientific robustness of any methodology, results,
conclusions, and mitigation options proposed by the trial team
The success of the trial will be determined by reference to pre-agreed success
criteria specifically adapted to include the findings of preliminary surveys. The ISAP
will be asked to review the appropriateness of these criteria prior to the trial
commencing
The MMO are prepared to undertake a new Appropriate Assessment based on any
new information which arises from the trial results and any modifications to the
proposed mitigation measures that may result from recommendations arising from
the trial.
The MMO require a licence for the translocation trial. The MMO also require a
licence for the preliminary sampling and post trial sampling. This activity would have
been exempt under the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985, but is not
exempt under the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 as set out in the Marine
Licensing (Exempted Activities) Order 2011.

L7 September 2013
Thank you for your recent correspondence regarding the UKs nuciear deterrent. As my
department is responsible for the nuclear deterrent, l will set out the Government's
policy
The Government believes that we need to take action to safeguard our national security
at home and abroad. Clearly, the renewal of a nuclear deterrent based on the Trident
missile system is not a decislon to be taken llghtly; however, the Govemment' s view is
that this is not he right time lor the UK to give it up. There are substantial isks to our
security from amerging nuclear woapons states. and so, while cormmittad to the iong-
term goal of nuclear disarmarment, we believe that we can best protect ourselves
against these threats by the continued operation of a submarine-based nuclear
deterrent. Accordingly, this Govemment has committed to maintain the deterrent and to
continue with the programme to renew it as debated and approved by a significant
majority in Parílament in 2007.
You suggest that money woukd be better spent in other areas. The Government has
been clear that the satety and security of the UK is its first priority and musi be seen a:s
a long term issue: immediate economic pressures are not sufficient rationale for taking
fong term risks with the security of the nation and British public tar into the future. The
costs oi replacing the deterrent are substantial and it is understandable that, given the
current economic problems, people wish to be reassured that this will be money weil
spent. Consequently within the Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR). which
reported in October 2010, the Govemment scrutinised in detail the replacement ot our
nuclear deterrent to assess value for money. As a result we identified t3.2 bilion of
savings and defarrais over ten years

The Governmenl is committed to playing a leading role in making the world sale from
the dangers ot nuclear weapons and nuclear proliferation and is tully engaged in the
intemational process to achieve this; hrough enforcing and supporting the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation ol Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The renewal of our nuclear deterrent is
fully consistent with our obigations under this treaty. The Foreign Secretary has made
public for the first time the maximum number of nuclear warheads we nold in our
stockpile, which goes further and is more transparent than any prevlous Govemment
His review of our nuclear declaratory policy also ensures it is appropriate for the
circumstances of today. We can now give a new and stronger assurance that we wik
not use nuctear weapons against non-nuciear weapon states that are in compliance with
their obligations under the NPT
The achievement af the UK's long tem goal of a workd without nuclear weapons could,
as the NPT Article VI notes, be underpinned by 'a treaty on general and complete
disarmament. However, it is the position of the Government that focusing effort now on
a measure such as this woukd be premature. To reach that point will require the correct
conditions to be in plsce, such as further measures on multilateral disarmament and
strengthened non-prolleration. Our priority must be to reach consensus on the entry
into lorce of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and stat negotiations on a Fissile
Material Cul-Off Trealy
There is no evidence or likelihood that others would tollow the UK down a unilateralist
route or smake it any more likely those countries of concem would abandon their current
nuclear ambitions. The Govemment's position is that we will only achieve sustainable
giobaf nuclear disarmament through multiateral negotiations and the NPT remains the
hest vehicle available to the international community tor achieving this. Therefore, the
Government wil contlnue to work within the NPT and with intemational partners to
advance progress towards our long-lerm shared goai of a world without nuclear
weapons
I hope that this response has helped to expiain the Govemment's position on this issue,
and should be grateful if you would arrange lar it to be posted on your Website. Please
accept it as a reply to you and your members to all correspondence on the matter. I wilt

Dear all
Last year, I wrote to every serving member of the Armed Forces to raise awareness of the Armed
Forces Covenant within the Military Community. As we have very recently published the 2014
Annual Report on the Covenant, I thought I would take the opportunity to contact you again.
It is important to be very clear about what the Armed Forces Covenant is for. It is a commitment
from the Government to help ensure that members of the Armed Forces Community are recognised
for what we do and that we are treated accordingly. The Government is committed to ensuring that
neither you, nor your family, face any disadvantage when it comes to the provision of public and
commercial services. It also recognises that in certain circumstances it is right that we give special
consideration to the most deserving of us, such as the injured and the bereaved
The Covenant does not mean that we will never be disadvantaged. It is about getting a fair deal
for the Armed Forces in recognition of the huge commitment and sacrifices that we make for our
country. You may think that in your current circumstances you have no need for the Covenant. This
may be true, but it is good to know that it is always there, ready to support us if we ever have to call
on it. The MOD, Other Government Departments, Family Federations and Charities are all working
closely together to deliver policies and programmes that support the Covenant.
Though we cannot completely remove disadvantage, there are things we can do to reduce it. So,
please take a few moments to look through the attached leaflet. This will give you more detail about
what the Covenant has delivered, what we plan to do next, and where you can go for help

Introduction
This document provides a response from Callcredit Information Group ("CIG") to the Cabinet Office
Open Consultation, "Better use of data in government."
CIG comprises a number of companies including Callcredit, a UK consumer credit reference agency,
which facilitates the sharing of data on how people manage their repayment commitments. Data
sharing is at the heart of our business and we provide services for both local and central government
which assist the effective provision, sharing and understanding of personal data.
Having experience of the value of sharing data, we see clear benefits from the proposals. In
particular, we agree that wider use of data sharing should improve the prevention, detection and
investigation of fraud. Some further comments on benefits in this area identified in the paper:
Aiding better targeting and threat-profiling of potentially fraudulent individuals
Increasing the volume of data available for analysis through sharing will provide valuable insight.
Strong analytics capabilities will also be needed, to effectively profile risk of fraudulent activity at the
prevention and detection stages, and provide actionable insight required for further investigation.
Combining the real-world experience of investigations staff, and the type of case profile they
intuitively target, with new data and strong analytics will ensure the most efficient targeting model
Saving taxpayers' money by streamlining processes
More effective targeting of resources is likely to reduce both investigation costs and processing
effort. As well as identifying cases which might otherwise have been missed, additional data can also
refine and clarify the need to investigate cases. For example, providing access to DWP data for Local
Authorities carrying out Tenancy Fraud investigation is likely to provide new information allowing
some cases to be rapidly confirmed as non-fraudulent without lengthy investigation.
Increasing the ability for Government to act more quickly on fraud
Data sharing allows rapid analysis and review of real-time information at the point of investigation.
Through our experience of creating and managing a Fraud Hub for Local Authority and Housing
Association data, we have seen how creating a data sharing platform for multiple organisations and
teams can simplify the multi-team investigation and referral process. With each organisation
adhering to the same data sharing agreement and process, the data held on a specific case is far
more complete, up to date and easily accessible.
CIG provides a partial response to the consultation paper, focusing on the questions appropriate to
our operations and experience.

Cabinet Office Consultation: Better Use of Data
April 2016
Q3: Should non-public authorities (such as private companies and charities)
that fulfil a public service function to a public authority be included in the
scope of the delivering public services power?
As the paper states, significant parts of public services are currently delivered by non-public sector
bodies, and so omitting these from scope of the power could greatly diminish its effectiveness. In
addition, close alignment of the public services power approach with the proposals to tackle fraud
and debt is desirable. Consistency of conditions and safeguards will reduce the potential for
uncertainty and multiple handling conditions. This may then encourage more confident - and
effectiVe Use or data
Q8: Should a government department be able to access birth details
electronically for the purpose of providing a public service, e.g. an application
for child benefit?
Yes. It is important to remove dependence on paper certificates, which as stated are easily forged or
altered. By reducing the need for manual handling, electronic provision can also cut the cost of
providing relevant public services.
Q9: Do you think bulk registration information, such as details of all deaths,
should be shared between civil registration officials and specified public
authorities to ensure records are kept up to date (e.g. to prevent
correspondence being sent to families of a deceased person)?
Yes. Consideration should also be given to allowing the private sector to access some information
for this purpose, subject to strong controls and measures similar to those already in place for the use
of death registration information for specified purposes in the private sector.
Bulk death registration information is currently shared with the private sector in an established
manner, for strictly prescribed purposes around the prevention of crime and fraud. The data cannot
be used for any other purposes, regardless of any benefits to bereaved citizens
If death registration data is to be used to prevent public sector correspondence being sent to
families of a deceased person, we contend that it should likewise be made available to prevent the
equal distress caused by sending of private sector correspondence in such circumstances.
We urge that a review of the current legislation should consider widening the purposes for which
the bulk death registration data can be used, to allow more support to people during the most
difficult times of their lives
Electronic provision of registration data would also have potential to help private companies to deal
more considerately and effectively with people, for example the recently bereaved.

Q10: Are there other measures which could be set out in the Code of Practice
covering the proposed new power to combat fraud to strengthen the
safeguards around access to data by specified public authorities?
Given the level of transparency in place, the measures proposed are already fairly prescriptive.
Imposing further measures could prove a disproportionate burden and so undermine the aim of
wider and more effective use of data. We would urge flexibility in measures. Care should be taken in
particular to avoid creating any highly specific requirements which could prove incompatible with
new technologies or new aims in the future.
Q11: It is proposed that the power to improve access to information by
public authorities to combat fraud will be reviewed by the Minister after a
defined period of time. This time will allow for pilots to be established and
outcomes and benefits evaluated. How long should the Fraud gateway be
operational for before it is reviewed?
Our experience of this would suggest that a longer period than the proposed 3 years might be
appropriate. We suggest that, if practicable, thought might be given to how the review could be
triggered by its operational development rather than a fixed timescale. 'Trigger events' could then
be defined, prompting the review once specific milestones have been reached

These proposals could and should go much further. The consultation talks about
opening up data sources in order to help tailor interventions through using better

Better Use of Data Consultation
The Greater Manchester Combined Authority and through it, GM - Connect,
welcomes the opportunity to comment on the proposed extension of data
sharing legislation outlined in the "Better Use of Data" consultation publication.
We extended an invitation to important partners across GM to participate irn
our consultation review. We have also included the views of NHS and local
authority partners who chose to participate in the review process with us
GM - Connect is a Greater Manchester-wide transformational data sharing
capability and governance structure hosted by the Greater Manchester
Combined Authority (GMCA).lt will direct and own the data-sharing strategy
across public agencies, promoting a GM-wide approach and supporting
agencies to resolve data sharing issues that are required to enable both
operational work and analytics. The core team will encompass Information
Governance, Innovation and Engagement, and Technology and Data
Analytics specialists who will support and provide a framework for existing GM
groups
We recognise the challenges in balancing the public service and financial
benefits which stem from effective data sharing against the desire to protect
personal information. We also respect the need for individuals to know and
understand the organisations and purposes their information is being used for.
This legislation will work towards gaining citizens trust and enable public
authorities to show their communities what can be achieved with appropriate
and supported information sharing. We would like to emphasise that our
response relates to the delivery of public services, ensuring financial and
service accountability to Government and the tax payer. We are not arguing
for shaing data for commercial purposes and do not in anv wav arque against
privacy. On the contrary. We propose that data should be shared securely and
safely in order to protect both privacy and life.
Progress also depends on whether proven methods of securely and
proportionally sharing data piloted via this proposed legislation lead to further
understanding of and confidence in balancing these potentially challenging
goals through opening up further areas of activity. The ease and speed by
which new objectives can be added, especially from public bodies outside of
core government departments will be a critical factor in enabling newly
devolved arrangements to flourish

Public sector organisations need to work in partnership to deliver the
improvements in service delivery, improvements in life outcomes for
individuals and associated reductions in cost of service delivery which will be
derived from effective data sharing. To achieve this aim the legislation and
associated guidance must be constructed to be clear and informative to avoid
a lack of clarity generating a risk averse culture at an operational level that
would detract from the progressive and supportive nature of this development.
This is particularly important when considering the permissive nature of the
proposals and the references to criminal sanctions.
The consultation questions are quite specific and before providing response:s
to them, there are some wider comments we would like to make
Intended Use
l he legislation is intended for use where
» The objective could not be met without data sharing;
» It is not realistic and practicable to use consent to achieve the intended
outcome or use of consent would not meet the criteria of free and
informed decision making; and
Sharing and analysis of de-identified data would not achieve the
intended outcome.
»
Arquably, any obiective could be met without data sharing if enouah resource
is deployed, up to and including the sharing of paper records using couriers.
The point is that automated data sharing reduces the resource commitment.
There is a danger that this criterion could be a focus to prevent data sharing
We would like to see this criterion reference that "The objective could not be
met cost effectively without data sharing or traditional Information sharing
methods would be too complex"
The Permissive Approach
The proposed gateway is "permissive" in that the provider can decide whether
or not to supply the data and there is no reference to a mechanism outlined to
appeal the decision. There has been a significant operational reluctance
within some public sector organisation to share data and while the rational for
a permissive approach is understood, this could be used without proper
understanding or full consideration of the significance of the request, to stifle
data sharing
There should be a presumption to share which would be supportive of the
message that Dame Caldicott has emphasised in her previous reviews. The
proposed code could outline classifications of acceptable reasons and, better
still, there could be an independent review. The Code could emphasise that
every endeavour should be made to achieve data sharing and that rejection of
the proposals needs to be a rare exception rather than the default setting. To
facilitate this could we request the legislation include a directional and clear
message that 'public sector bodies should seek opportunities to share data for
public benefit unless there is a legal or regulatory reason not to do so.' So
much of the legislation is dedicated to enabling sharing without a clear simple
statement around intent. A clear statement like the one above will be a huge
help in enabling us to lead in making sure the intent of the act is locally
executed
Safeguarding
The draft legislation is specifically structured to say that nothing in these
proposed provisions prevents the use of information for (amongst other
things) safeguarding vulnerable adults or children. The implication being that
existing leaislatton is already sufficient for safequarding purposes
While it could be considered adequate, it is based around being reactive
because the test of "proportionality" is vague and subjective and leads to a
risk averse approach when matters have escalated and there already is a
potential safeguarding problem, effectively preventing the intent outlined in
DFE Regulations - "No single professional can have a full picture of a child's
needs and circumstances and, if children and families are to receive the right
help at the right time, everyone who comes into contact with them has a role
to play In identifying concerns, sharing Information ana raking prompt
action."(DFE Regulations)
Emphasis needs to shift to being much more preventative in nature and data
sharing would assist in highlighting emerging problems and situations which
could be dealt with early
A definition or description of what would be considered "safeguarding" would
go a long way to supporting the aspirations on not only this Bill, but
supporting the inter agency sharing of information that is necessary to prevent
both children and vulnerable adults slipping into statutory interventions. This
definition could then provide the ability to undertake preventative enquiries
not only at a community level but for those individuals that have been showrn
to be the most vulnerable in society.
Purpose
In outlining the purposes of the legislation (para 39) it refers to three purpose:s
including (c) the improvement of the well being of individuals
In drafting the legislation, however, the reference to well being in (c) above
has been combined with the reference to fuel poverty.
Was it the intention to limit this objective to fuel poverty because the
interpretation "of improvement of well being" could be wide ranging and would
enable public bodies to approach data sharing from a wider context? We
would welcome specific inclusion of this as an objective
Criminal Offence
We note the introduction of criminal liability and recognise that in the ultimate
circumstances this could well be warranted. However, the very inclusion of
such a provision acts in a risk averse way to inhibit data sharing. There is a
significant difference between data sharing which is negligent and that which
is undertaken for "samaritarian" purposes. The Codes of Practice need to be
very clear in this area to give public sector workers confidence, otherwise the
legislation will become a second tier of paralysis caused by fear of
prosecution.
Health and Social Care Data
The commentary outlines that health and care data plays a critical role in the
design and delivery of public services but a specific initial objective in this area
is precluded because it is believed additional safeguards will be needed and
these need to be in line with the findings of the Dame Caldicotf's review due in
early 2016
We cannot emphasise enough how critical it is to include an objective in this
area. A major plank of the devolution deal for Greater Manchester and, in
reality, a pathfinder for the whole of the country is the integration of health and
social care
While the sensitivities surrounding health records are appreciated, basic
operational data needs to be shared to enable services to be integrated.
Moreover, the key factor is to move much further towards prevention ratheir
than reactive treatment and this will be facilitated by effective predictive data
analysis
While it is accepted that additional safeguards are required around medical
data, the data which drives efficient coordination of care between health and
social care is not concerned with detailed medical histories. It is
administrative data not clinical data and if health and social care services are
to remain free at the point of delivery, the efficiency we require is critical. We
recommend that a distinction between the types of data held by Health
agencies is made clear and different standards are clearly applied to each.
For example, it would be helpful if all public agencies could access the GP
register at times of emergency so that the GP can be contacted. This process
will not reveal clinical data but will enable the GP to carry out their duties more
effectively and improve health and safety outcomes for citizens.
As the boundaries between Public Services continue to blur with the
necessity for integrated ways of working, the need for access to data from
multiple agencies to support families and individuals with complex needs
continues to grow. For example, health and social care data needs to
encompass community safety where the blue light services play an active part
in people's lives where health and social care matters are at the heart of their
intervention. There needs to be a much clearer view about the definitions of
and bodies involved with health and social care data which facilitates rather
than Inhibits joined up service delivery, early intervention and prevention. .
This may be achieved by changing the definition of "direct care" to incorporate
the above type of responses, direct and the ability to identify preventative
ways to provide interventions to improve health and wellbeing
Finally it is noted that health and social care data is specifically excluded in
the proposals for commissioning research by clause 8 (3) which excludes
health and social care bodies. lt is understood that this is also based on a
need to consider the outcome of the Caldicott review so may be amended
once the position is clarified
Combating Fraud
The proposals feel very much about data matching to provide evidence to
prosecute existing fraud.
lt is perhaps a presumption that proposed pilot activity could extend to the
prevention of fraud as covered by the 2006 Fraud Act. This area seems to be
inhibited currently, for example, in relation to proving continued access to
benefit, quardianship pavments or validating single person discounts
It would be helpful if the proposed codes provided practical examples or
commentary which aligns with the Fraud Act
Note that the list of specified persons does not include the Combined
Authority for Greater Manchester (including Transport for Greater Manchester)
and other relevant devolution bodies. See also comments below about the
potential inefficient approach which could feature in the proposed Codes of
Practice.
Reducing Debt
It is not at all clear if these proposals will add value. There would need to be
clarity about how arrangements could fairly address debt across public bodies
on a pro rata basis. They also need to address the fundamental difference
between someone who cannot pay the debt and those who won't pay it
The proposals are too narrow and do not address some practical issues which
surround dealing with debt. For example, currently Council Tax services may

This is my response to the Better use of data in government consultation
I want citizens' privacy to be put at the heart of the data sharing proposals.
To this end, I believe that there should be mandatory central registers of data transfers between
departments to improve auditing of the system and for future transparency.
Moreover, proposals for data about debt to be shared between government departments need to be
dropped. Creating a database of people who are in debt has enormous privacy implications for
vulnerable people facing economic hardship. While compiling their details in one place may seem a
positive move in terms of targeting services, this could very easily lead to stigmatisation of those in
debt.
Finally, proposals for bulk sharing of birth, marriage and death data should be removed - this is an
unnecessary invasion of privacy.
Yours sincerely

This is my response to the Better use of data in government consultation.
I want citizens' privacy to be put at the heart of the data sharing proposals.
We need to ensure that all safeguards are effective and controls and limitations are included in the
face of the bill and not in codes of practices. We also need to ensure that lowering barriers does not
lead to proliferation of invasive databases
There should be a central public register of what data is shared, where it's from and where it goes
This would help with auditing of the system to check whether it is working properly and if it has been
abused.
Government sharing of data from the General Registry Office has a whiff of ID Cards lite. These plans
should also be dropped.
The proposed database of people who are in debt to public bodies won't help reduce overall debt.
There are privacy implications for vulnerable people in economic hardship and this policy may not
even improve public finances. The plans should be dropped. Centralising information about people in
debt to Government only makes sense if it helps increase recovery and reduce hardship. Current
proposals need to be dropped and reconsidered as part of a broader strategy on debt.
If Parliament is not to have a role in authorising data sharing there needs be mechanisms for
challenging any new agreements without the need to go to court for a judicial review.
Yours sincerely

Data Sharing Policy Team
Past history has shown us quite clearly that without effective auditing and oversight, data can be used
ineffectively or even unethically, ensuring auditing for data transfer and stopping bulk data sharing I
find to be entirely proportional and fair limitations to citizen's data rights
The database of debtors also seems to be an easily abused concept, one that could lead to unfair
treatment of those under economic hardship, what systems would be put in place to protect this from
occurring?
Thank you for reading my points

departments to improve auditing of the system and for future transparency.
Moreover, proposals for data about debt to be shared between government departments need to be
dropped. Creating a database of people who are in debt has enormous privacy implications for
vulnerable people facing economic hardship. While compiling their details in one place may seem a
positive move in terms of targeting services, this could very easily lead to stigmatisation of those in
debt.
Finally, proposals for bulk sharing of birth, marriage and death data should be removed - this is an
unnecessary invasion of privacy.
Yours sincerely

This is my response to the Better use of data in government consultation.
I want citizens' privacy to be put at the heart of the data sharing proposals.
We need to ensure that all safeguards are effective and controls and limitations are included in the
face of the bill and not in codes of practices. We also need to ensure that lowering barriers does not
lead to proliferation of invasive databases
There should be a central public register of what data is shared, where it's from and where it goes
This would help with auditing of the system to check whether it is working properly and if it has been
abused.
Government sharing of data from the General Registry Office has a whiff of ID Cards lite. These plans
should also be dropped.
The proposed database of people who are in debt to public bodies won't help reduce overall debt.
There are privacy implications for vulnerable people in economic hardship and this policy may not
even improve public finances. The plans should be dropped. Centralising information about people in
debt to Government only makes sense if it helps increase recovery and reduce hardship. Current
proposals need to be dropped and reconsidered as part of a broader strategy on debt.
If Parliament is not to have a role in authorising data sharing there needs be mechanisms for
challenging any new agreements without the need to go to court for a judicial review.
Yours sincerely

Data Sharing Policy Team
Past history has shown us quite clearly that without effective auditing and oversight, data can be used
ineffectively or even unethically, ensuring auditing for data transfer and stopping bulk data sharing I
find to be entirely proportional and fair limitations to citizen's data rights
The database of debtors also seems to be an easily abused concept, one that could lead to unfair
treatment of those under economic hardship, what systems would be put in place to protect this from
occurring?
Thank you for reading my points

This is my response to the Better use of data in government consultation
I warnt citizens' privacy to be put at the heart of the data sharing proposals
Among specific issues, the proposal for a database of people in debt appears decidedly oppressive, with
chilling implications for people who are already vulnerable.
Such legislation, more generaily needs to be limited in scope and proportionate.

ocrContTitle : STHE ASSOCIATION OF ELECTORAL
ADMINISTRATORS
Formal response to the Better Use of Data Consultation
Paper
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1. The Association of Electoral Administrators (AEA) was founded in 1987
and is the professional body representing the interests of electoral
administrators in the United Kingdom. It is a non-governmental and non-
partisan body and has some 1,866 members, the majority of whom are
employed by local authorities to provide electoral registration and election
services
1.2. This paper sets out the AEA's views in relation to the questions raised in
the consultation document published in February 2016.
1.3. The AEA's primary concern is about the effect of any proposed changes to
the law which would impact on electoral registration and the administration of
elections and which might arise as a result of the issues identified in the
consultation paper. Any such changes would need to be carefully considered irn
terms of the practical implications and the way in which the changes would be
introduced and administered
1.4 The consultation paper in general does not cover electoral registration.
However, we have responded to some of the questions in the consultation
paper, where appropriate. However, paragraph 1 highlights that proportionate
secure and well-governed sharing of information between public authorities
can improve the lives of citizens, support decision on the economy which allow
our businesses to flourish, and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the
public sector. Section 2 highlights two areas which requires legislation to allow
public agencies to share personal data with other public agencies in specific
contexts in order to improve the welfare of the individual in question. The AEA
believes there is a third area which could be explored as part of this
consultation paper and would support John Penrose MP, the Minister for
Constitution Reform, in terms of his vision on the future of electoral
registration. Individual electoral registration has recently been introduced and
eligible residents can now register to vote online. However, whilst registration
is available on line, legislation still requires numerous manual stages with
household enquiry forms and invitations to register along with an annual
household canvass. Whilst the Electoral Registration Officer (ERO) can access
local authority records for data matching to identify potential new electors
access to other public data sources would assist the ERO in ensuring the
electoral register is complete and accurate. The Minister's vision for electoral
registration aims to make electoral registration more efficient and to reduce
bureaucracy and costs. It is therefore important that the work of the Minister
in relation to his vision links into this programme given the objective of a
complete and accurate register of electors along with the efficiencies which
would be achieved with increased access to data held by public bodies. Such
an approach would also make it easier for citizens to register to vote
1.5 This approach is supported in paragraph 10 of the consultation paper
which states "Public authorities are operating within a time of great spending
restraint. As a result, there needs to be a shift to more collaborative ways of
working between public authorities to improve the effectiveness of operations
whilst driving down costs...Greater data-enabled collaboration between public
authorities can help ensure citizens receive the services they require......
2. ANSWERS TO SPECIFIC QUESTIONS
IMPROVING PUBLIC SERVICE DELIVERY
1. Are there any objectives that you believe should be included in this
power that would not meet these criteria?
No comment. However, the AEA believes that a new objective could be
included which would meet the criteria set out, namely, the use of public data
to ensure the register of electors is as complete and accurate as possible. This
can be linked to paragraph 39 section b: the facilitation of the provision of a
benefit (whether or not financial) to individuals of a particular description. At
present, if an elector fails verification with DWP records at the application
stage and the ERO fails to data match against local authority records, the
potential elector has to provide documentary evidence before the ERO can
register them to vote. Access to other public data records would increase the
data sets available for the ERO to verify against which could mean that the
elector becomes registered without having to provide the documentary
evidence
Paragraph 40 outlines two initial objectives set out in proposed legislation:
» automatic provision of fuel poverty assistance to those most in need, and
improving the ability to identify families who would benefit from the
Troubled Families programme.
Based on the above and looking at the future of electoral registration, this is
an opportunity to make a radical change, namely, instead of EROs conducting
an annual household canvass to compile the register of electors, electors could
be registered automatically using reliable public data sources.
2
2. Are there any public authorities that you consider would not fit
under this. definition
An Electoral Registration Officer (ERO) - the Representation of the People Act
1983 requires that each local authority appoints an officer of the council to be
the registration officer. An ERO is not a public authority.
3. Should non-public authorities (such as private companies and
charities) that fulfil a public service function to a public authority be
included in the scope of the delivering public services power?
Yes - Access to public utility services data records such as electricity, gas, and
water would assist EROs in ensuring all those residents who are eligible to
register are registered to vote
4. Are these the correct principles that should be set out in the Code of
Practice for this power?
No comment.
PROVIDING ASSISTANCE TO CITIZENS LIVING IN FUEL POVERTY
5. Should the Government share information with non-public sector
organisations as proposed for the sole purpose of providing
assistance to citizens lIVIng in fuel poverty?
No comment.
6. Would the provision of energy bill rebates, alongside information
about energy efficiency support, be appropriate forms of assistance
to citizens living in fuel poverty?
No comment.
7. Are there other forms of fuel poverty assistance for citizens that
should be considered for inclusion in the proposed power?
No comment.
ACCESS TO CIVIL REGISTRATION TO IMPROVE PUBLIC SERVICE
DELIVERY
8. Should a government department be able to access birth details
electronically for the purpose of providing a public service, e.g. an
application for child benefit?
This principle already applies within the context of electoral registration when
an applicant's name and national insurance number is checked against DWP
3
records as part of the verification process. Based on this principle, then a
government department should be able to check birth details electronically.
Whilst this data may not assist an ERO directly, access to those government
records for example, DVLA records, TV licences and other public data could
mean a person is verified and registered to vote by data matching against such
records if the applicant fails at DWP verification. As above, this could mean
that the applicant does not have to provide documentary evidence.
9. Do you think bulk registration information, such as details of all
deaths, should be shared between civil registration officials and
specified public authorities to ensure records are kept up to date (e.g
to prevent correspondence being sent to families of a deceased
person)?
Yes. The Electoral Registration Officer receives data from their local registran
relating to deaths in their area so that the person is then removed from the
register of electors which will prevent correspondence such of poll cards and
postal votes for an election being sent to the deceased person. This also
reduces the opportunity for electoral fraud.
COMBATING FRAUD AGAINST THE PUBLIC SECTOR THROUGH FASTER
AND SIMPLER ACCESS TO DATA
10. Are there other measures which could be set out in the Code of
Practice covering the proposed new power to combat fraud to
strengthen the safeguards around access to data by specified public
authorities?
No comment,
11. It is proposed that the power to improve access to information by
public authorities to combat fraud will be reviewed by the Minister
after a defined period of time. This time will allow for pilots to be
established and outcomes and benefits evaluated. How long should the
Fraud gateway be operational for before it is reviewed?
No comment.
IMPROVING ACCESS TO DATA TO ENABLE BETTER MANAGEMENT OF
DEBT OWED TO THE PUBLIC SECTOR
12. Which organisations should Government work with to ensure
fairness is paramount when making decisions about affordability for
vulnerable debtors who owe multiple debts?
No comment.
4
13. How can Government ensure the appropriate scrutiny so pilots
under the power are effectively designed and deliver against the
objectives of the power?
No comment.
14. It is proposed that the power to improve access to information by
public authorities for the purpose of better managing debt owed to
government will be reviewed by the Minister after a defined period of
time. This time will allow for pilots to be established and outcomes and
benefits evaluated. How long should the debt power be operational for
before it is reviewed?
No comment.
ACCESS TO DATA WHICH MUST BE LINKED AND DE-IDENTIFIED USING
DEFINED PROCESSES FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES
15. Should fees be charged by public authorities for providing data
for research purposes, and if so should there be a maximum fee
permitted which is monitored by the UK Statistics Authority?
No comment in relation to fees for research purposes. However, the fees
charged for the sale of the full and edited register of electors should be at a
rate that reflects the costs of compiling and maintaining the register of
electors. The current fees set out in legislation do not reflect this and local
authorities are subsidising profit making companies with the sale of the
register of electors.
16. To ensure a consistent approach towards departments acceptingg
or declining requests for disclosing information for research projects,
should the UK Statistics Authority as the accreditation body publish
details of rejected applications and the reasons for their rejection?
No comment.
17. What principles or criteria do you think should be used to identify
research that has the potential for public benefit, or research that will
not be in the public benefit?
No comment.
ACCESS BY UK STATISTICS AUTHORITY TO IDENTIFIED DATA FOR
THE PURPOSE OF PRODUCING OFFICIAL STATISTICS AND
RESEARCH

Subject: Resopnse to Consultation - Better Use of Data
To: "data-sharing@cabinetoffice.gov.uk" <data-sharing@cabinetoffice.gov.uk>
Dear Sir/Madam
Please note, I am not answering on behalf of the
but in my own personal capacity. T am a qualified (non-practising) solicitor with a Master of
Laws in data protection.
My comments concern Consultation Questions 17 and 20 (the disclosure of information for
research purposes Bill/proposals), and in particular the extent to which the EU's
directly-applicable GDPR is taken into account with respect to these.
I note on page 8 of the Consultation Paper, at section 25, mention is made of the upcoming
GDPR, however l am concerned by the lack of reference to this in the Bill/proposals.
Fundamental/Human Rights are inherent in the GDPR, and in its overall structure. Such
rights are widely interpreted by the ECtHR/ECJ, with narrow exceptions permitted for any
interference, and are reflected in the language of the GDPR (Council of the EU revised text
dated 6 April 2016), as set out below
Article 9(2)
processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest, on the basis of
Union or Member State law which shall be proportionate to the aim pursued, respect
the essence of the right to data protection and provide for suitable and specifid
measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject;
or
Article 9(21(i
processing is necessary for archiving purposes in the public interest, or scientifc and
historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1)
based on Union or Member State law which shall be proportionate to the aim
pursued, respect the essence of the right to data protection and provide for suitable
and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the
data subject
Processing of personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest, or scientific
and historical research purposes or statistical purposes, shall be subject to in
accordance with this Regulation appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms
of the data subject
All examples above require any derogations from the prohibition on the processing of special
categories of personal data to provide for, and be subject to, safeguards for the rights and
freedoms of the data subject. Beyond a brief mention of the ECHR Article 8 right to privacy
on page 8 (section 26) of the consultation and in Annex B of the Evidence Base, I cannot
see this reflected adequately in the Bill.
The GDPR contains other specific provisions relevant to the sharing of data for research, for
example on Privacy by Design and Default (Article 25), Joint Data Controllers (Article 26)
and Security of Processing (Article 32) specifically in relation to
pseudonymisation/encryption of personal data, which need to be taken into account, along
with a definition of pseudonymisation.
Though the GDPR has achieved tripartite agreement at EU level and will become directly
applicable in 2018 across all member states, the UK "Brexit" referendum decision is
imminent. I believe that the UK's position in relation to the EU will, however, have negligible
effect on the EU's requirements on protection of citizen's data: the UK will be continually
required to demonstrate a high standard of data protection and protection of fundamental
rights of the data subject in order to trade; EU jurisprudence is now embedded in UK case
law; and the UK will still no doubt be continued to be bound by a number of EU-like laws for
some time to come, including the GDPR.
Kind regards

Consultation questions
Improving public service deliver
1. Are there any objectives that you believe should be included in this power that would
not meet these criteria?
No, however clarity around data sharing principals, purpose, source and ongoing
governance arrangements (including consent) for information at local levels need to
be understood and clarified
2. Are there any public authorities that you consider would not fit under this definition?
No, but it may be too broad. A function of a public nature' for the purposes of this
legislation needs to be defined. The schedule listing the specified public authorities
should not include non-public authorities that may be included in the legislation in
some way because they are exercising functions of a public nature on behalf of a
specified public authority, see below
3. Should non-public authorities (such as private companies and charities) that fulfil a
public service function to a public authority be included in the scope of the
delivering public services power?
Yes, but the non-public sector body should be required to disclose information to
the public sector body for which it is fulfilling a public service function and not
directly to any other bodies. Therefore non-public authorities would not be included
in the schedule of specified public authorities. Legislation needs to be clear about
the conditions under which non-public sector bodies will be included in the scope of
the public service delivery power and how, for example when they are fulfiling a
public service function to a public authority under contract or under the conditions of
a grant. As above 'function of a public nature' needs to be defined. Legislation must
also be clear about what non-public sector bodies are and the definition of private
companies, charities, not for profit organisations and social enterprises.
4.
Are these the correct principles that should be set out in the Code of Practice for this
power?
Yes
Providing assistance to citizens livina in fuel povert
5. Should the Government share information with non-public sector organisations as
proposed for the sole purpose of providing assistance to citizens living in fuel
poverty [or for any other reason]?
Yes, it should for this sole purpose
6. Would the provision of energy bill rebates, alongside information about
energy efficiency support, be appropriate forms of assistance to citizens living
in fuel poverty?
Yes
7. Are there other forms of fuel poverty assistance for citizens that should be
considered for inclusion in the proposed power?
Could anything be done to ensure citizens living in fuel poverty received
the lowest fuel tariff automatically. The information should also be shared
with local authorities so they can target promotion of take up of energy
efficiency support to landlords?
Access to civil registration to improve public service delive
8. Should a government department be able to access birth details electronically for
the purpose of providing a public service, e.g. an application for child benefit?
Yes. The information should also be available to other public authorities e.g. Clinical
Commissioning Groups and local authorities so that other benefits can be applied
e.g. dependent children for housing and council tax benefit claims
9. Do you think bulk registration information, such as details of all deaths, should be
shared between civil registration officials and specified public authorities to ensure
records are kept up to date (e.g. to prevent correspondence being sent to families of
a deceased person)?
Yes
Overall we would like to be able to understand the impact of these proposals on our
local registration service and how it is funded. Specifically we would like more detail
on the fees for disclosure of information. In the example given for Child Benefit
would the General Register Office get a fee from the HMRC for each birth certificate
checked? tn effect shifting some income from local authority registration services to
the General Register Office.
How does this proposal relate to the government's current Tell Us Once service, wil
that be superseded by this new process?
Combating fraud against the public sector through faster and simpler access to data
10. Are there other measures which could be set out in the Code of Practice covering the
proposed new power to combat fraud to strengthen the safeguards around access to
data by specified public authorities?
Current measures are adequate and we have no suggestions for additional
measures
11. It is proposed that the power to improve access to information by public authorities to
combat fraud will be reviewed by the Minister after a defined period of time. This time
will allow for pilots to be established and outcomes and benefits evaluated. How long
should the Fraud gateway be operational for before it is reviewed?
In light of the time it takes to organise this type of pilot we suggest three years, one
to cover the set-up and two years to enable active data matching and analysis of the
effectiveness of the system
Improving access to data to enable better management of debt owed to the public sector
12. Which organisations should Government work with to ensure fairness is paramount
when making decisions about affordability for vulnerable debtors who owe multiple
debts?
All public facing organisations that require some financial assessment for the
provision of services e.g. Local Authorities particularly in respect of housing benefits
and social care functions. Financial help bodies such as Citizen Advice and Credit
Unions may be included. Information and sharing agreements plus individual
consent /confidentiality could pose some issues
13. How can Government ensure the appropriate scrutiny so pilots under the power are
effectively designed and deliver against the objectives of the power?
Government should specify criteria under each of the objectives that the pilots must
deliver and proper governance arrangements need to be in place which match the
objectives
14. It is proposed that the power to improve access to information by public authorities
for the purpose of better managing debt owed to government will be reviewed by the
Minister after a defined period of time. This time will allow for pilots to be established
and outcomes and benefits evaluated. How long should the debt power be
operational for before it is reviewed?
Time will be needed to establish a detailed and complex project, allow for the debt to
be identified, managed, reduced and reported on so that it is possible to evaluate
the pilots against set criteria. This may take three years or more
Access to data which must be linked and de-identified using defined processes for research
urposes
15. Should fees be charged by public authorities for providing data for research
purposes, and if so should there be a maximum fee permitted which is monitored by
the UK Statistics Authority?
Yes fees should be charged. Providing data can be a complex and time consuming
process. Based on the experience of FOls the fee should reflect the amount of work
and costs needed to make the data available. There should not be a maximum fee
rather public authorities must have the power to decline requests they consider wil
be unreasonably burdensome
16. To ensure a consistent approach towards departments accepting or declining
requests for disclosing information for research projects, should the UK Statistics
Authority as the accreditation body publish details of rejected applications and the
reasons for their rejection?
Yes, this would be useful, especially for identifying previous requests for
information.
17. What principles or criteria do you think should be used to identify research that has
the potential for public benefit, or research that will not be in the public benefit?
The proposed research should state the issue being addressed and what the
public benefit and/or who the public beneficiaries will be including general and
specific populations or communities. The proposal should include how the
possible benefit could be assessed and monitored, e.g. quantitative measures
such as unit cost reductions, reduced demand for public services, services
outputs, and/or qualitative measures such as improved service user/public
satisfaction.
The research proposal should explain how publicly available data has been
explored and what further insights and benefits are anticipated from the
additional data requested for disclosure
The proposed research should not be solely or primarily for the achievement of
qualifications, we already receive numerous FOl requests from students
effectively asking us to do work for them
The proposed research must include plans to share the findings and published
them in an open and transparent way including anonymised or de-identified
data sets
The proposed research should not provide direct financial benefits to a limited
or private interest.
The proposed research must include a timescale for completing the research
and producing the findings within a reasonable period
Research findings should be shared with the public authorities that provided
research data in advance of publication.
The proposed research should not damage the public interest e.g. reducing the
effectiveness and competitiveness of public service markets (e.g. the care
market) or aiming to maximise profit for private interests from public service
provision

Access by UK Statistics Authority to identified data for the purpose of producing official
statistics and research

Subject: Resopnse to Consultation - Better Use of Data
To: "data-sharing@cabinetoffice.gov.uk" <data-sharing@cabinetoffice.gov.uk>
Dear Sir/Madam
Please note, I am not answering on behalf of the
but in my own personal capacity. T am a qualified (non-practising) solicitor with a Master of
Laws in data protection.
My comments concern Consultation Questions 17 and 20 (the disclosure of information for
research purposes Bill/proposals), and in particular the extent to which the EU's
directly-applicable GDPR is taken into account with respect to these.
I note on page 8 of the Consultation Paper, at section 25, mention is made of the upcoming
GDPR, however l am concerned by the lack of reference to this in the Bill/proposals.
Fundamental/Human Rights are inherent in the GDPR, and in its overall structure. Such
rights are widely interpreted by the ECtHR/ECJ, with narrow exceptions permitted for any
interference, and are reflected in the language of the GDPR (Council of the EU revised text
dated 6 April 2016), as set out below
Article 9(2)
processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest, on the basis of
Union or Member State law which shall be proportionate to the aim pursued, respect
the essence of the right to data protection and provide for suitable and specifid
measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject;
or
Article 9(21(i
processing is necessary for archiving purposes in the public interest, or scientifc and
historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1)
based on Union or Member State law which shall be proportionate to the aim
pursued, respect the essence of the right to data protection and provide for suitable
and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the
data subject
Processing of personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest, or scientific
and historical research purposes or statistical purposes, shall be subject to in
accordance with this Regulation appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms
of the data subject
All examples above require any derogations from the prohibition on the processing of special
categories of personal data to provide for, and be subject to, safeguards for the rights and
freedoms of the data subject. Beyond a brief mention of the ECHR Article 8 right to privacy
on page 8 (section 26) of the consultation and in Annex B of the Evidence Base, I cannot
see this reflected adequately in the Bill.
The GDPR contains other specific provisions relevant to the sharing of data for research, for
example on Privacy by Design and Default (Article 25), Joint Data Controllers (Article 26)
and Security of Processing (Article 32) specifically in relation to
pseudonymisation/encryption of personal data, which need to be taken into account, along
with a definition of pseudonymisation.
Though the GDPR has achieved tripartite agreement at EU level and will become directly
applicable in 2018 across all member states, the UK "Brexit" referendum decision is
imminent. I believe that the UK's position in relation to the EU will, however, have negligible
effect on the EU's requirements on protection of citizen's data: the UK will be continually
required to demonstrate a high standard of data protection and protection of fundamental
rights of the data subject in order to trade; EU jurisprudence is now embedded in UK case
law; and the UK will still no doubt be continued to be bound by a number of EU-like laws for
some time to come, including the GDPR.
Kind regards

Consultation questions
Improving public service deliver
1. Are there any objectives that you believe should be included in this power that would
not meet these criteria?
No, however clarity around data sharing principals, purpose, source and ongoing
governance arrangements (including consent) for information at local levels need to
be understood and clarified
2. Are there any public authorities that you consider would not fit under this definition?
No, but it may be too broad. A function of a public nature' for the purposes of this
legislation needs to be defined. The schedule listing the specified public authorities
should not include non-public authorities that may be included in the legislation in
some way because they are exercising functions of a public nature on behalf of a
specified public authority, see below
3. Should non-public authorities (such as private companies and charities) that fulfil a
public service function to a public authority be included in the scope of the
delivering public services power?
Yes, but the non-public sector body should be required to disclose information to
the public sector body for which it is fulfilling a public service function and not
directly to any other bodies. Therefore non-public authorities would not be included
in the schedule of specified public authorities. Legislation needs to be clear about

ocrContTitle : E.ON response to the Better Use of Data consultation paper
Executive Summary
E.ON is committed to helping people to control their energy use and to deliver affordable energy
for them in a sustainable way. The long-term, sustainable solution to fuel poverty is to improve
the energy efficiency of existing, often old, housing stock. However, fuel poor and vulnerable
households also need help with their energy costs to be able to afford to heat their homes.
·
. The Warm Home Discount (WHD) scheme provides direct financial support to vulnerable
households to help them keep their homes warm during the colder months. Households are also
provided with advice on how to manage their energy use to ensure future energy costs are kept
as affordable as possible
. We welcomed the announcement in the Spending Review last year that the WHD scheme wil
continue for a further five years. We support changes being made to the scheme to improve the
targeting of fuel poor households in the future to ensure that support goes to those who need it
most. Doing this cost effectively relies on widening existing data sharing powers, as proposed in
this consultation, to identify low income high cost households through data matching
identifying eligible fuel poor households through data matching will reduce WHD administration
costs considerably, ensuring that more support can reach those who need it most. At the
moment, only pensioner households can be automatically identified for the Core Group, WHD
rebate with other vulnerable customers (the 'Broader Group') needing to apply and be verified
by the energy supplier. In our experience, Broader Group rebates are over thirty times more
expensive to administer than Core Group rebates. Wider data sharing, allowing a greater
proportion of WHD recipients to be automatically matched, will significantly reduce the overal!
administration costs and will increase the cost-effectiveness of the scheme overall.
We therefore support the data sharing proposals to achieve this and the broader principles on
which the changes are based. We also agree that safeguarding the use of the data must be a
priority and that there should be strong sanctions in place to deter misuse of data. However,
government will need to make sure that any sanctions intended to penalise suppliers for
unlawfully sharing data do not unintentionally disadvantage intended WHD recipients.
o We support making WHD Core Group recipients automatically eligible for measures under
supplier obligation schemes. Fuel poor households, by definition, will live in properties that are
costly to keep warm due to being poorly insulated and these are the very homes that supplier
obligation schemes seek to target. Since the primary focus of these schemes in the future will
also be to tackle fuel poverty, then if households have already been identified as fuel poor and
eligible to receive the WHD rebate, it makes practical sense not to require a separate application
process or eligibility check to qualify for energy efficiency measures under a supplier obligation
As a business with considerable experience of completing surveys for the Office of National
Statistics (ONS), we do not feel that the administrative burden or the associated costs are
excessive. We would prefer to retain the ability to provide robust and accurate data ourselves to
the ONS rather this being done through more modern methods of data collection.
We have responded to the questions below that are relevant to E.ON as an obligated supplier
and as a business that submits returns to the ONS. We have not commented on questions
outside of these areas of activity
Improving public service deliver
Question 1
Are there any objectives that you believe should be included in this power that would not meet
these criteria?
1. No comments.
Question 2
Are there any public authorities that you consider would not fit under this definition?
2. No comments.
Question3
Should non-public authorities (such as private companies and charities) that fulfil a public service
function to a public authority be included in the scope of the delivering public services power?
We agree that excluding non-public sector bodies which deliver a public service would limit the
effectiveness of the power. We believe that the power to share data should include non-public
authorities where the delivery of the public service meets the principle objective of the power,
namely to benefit individuals.
3.
. In our capacity as an obligated supplier within the scope of both the WHD and Energy Company
Obligation (ECO) schemes, we are in no doubt that our ability to deliver cost effectively under
future obligated schemes depends upon successful sharing of available data to allow eligible
households to be identified as efficiently as possible. At the same time, we welcome the
proposal that the gateway is permissive, meaning that the public authorities able to use the
power can decide whether or not to disclose data.
4.
Question 4
Are these the correct principles that should be set out in the Code of Practice for this power?
5. Yes, we support all of the principles outlined in paragraph 44· It is vital that data is shared only
for defined purposes and that these are clearly laid out. It is also crucial that safeguards are in
place to prevent the misuse of shared data and that any sanctions for breach of the rules are
robust and effective, but without unintended consequences.
6. We fully agree that no datasets should be shared outside the public sector (paragraph 54) and
that the only information shared between energy suppliers and Government should be ain
"eligibility flag". This would ensure that the Data Protection Act (DPA) 1998 is not weakened irn
any way and that the information provided to energy suppliers is proportionate.
7. We are committed to ensuring we fully adhere to the DPA 1998 and any associated data sharing
regulations and believe these should be strongly enforced. However, we believe that introducing
the power to withhold eligibility information from suppliers, whilst providing a powerful
deterrent against misusing the data, would ultimately disadvantage customers more than energy
suppliers and undermine the key principles this consultation is setting out to achieve.
8. In order to prevent duplicate payments the current automatic data sharing process utilises a
qualifying date. The eligibility flag for any given customer is sent to the energy supplier that
supplied the customer on an agreed date (for scheme year five the date was 12th July 2015)
Excluding one energy supplier from the process would lead to an enormous amount of confusion
for customers who might be unsure whether they need to apply for. the discount or if it will be
provided to them automatically.
9. In addition to the extra cost an energy supplier will incur by trying to identify qualifying
customers, there is also an extremely high likelihood that a proportion of eligible customers will
not contact their energy supplier and therefore miss out on the help that they are entitled to. As
stated in paragraph 46, 'relying on citizens to step forward and apply always results in some
people missing-out'. We would ask that the practical considerations of such a measure be
carefully considered to ensure that any deterrent for misuse of data does not have a detrimental
impact on customers and prevent those most in need from receiving assistance.
Providing assistance to citizens living in fuel povert
Question 5
Should the Government share information with non-public sector organisations as proposed for
the sole purpose of providíng assistance to citizens living in fuel poverty?
10. We believe that the Government should share information with the relevant non-public sector
organisations to provide assistance to households living in fuel poverty. As stated in our
response to question 3, the ability of obligated suppliers to deliver cost effectively under future
obligation schemes depends upon successful sharing of available data to allow eligible
households to be identified as efficiently as possible.
11. A key element of the current data sharing arrangement is the provision of the WHD helpline for
customers with queries about the data matching process. This helpline is administered by the
Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and supports customers who have not beern
automatically matched and therefore need to provide additional information in order to receivie
the WHD rebate
12. We believe it is vital that this service remains in place. As energy suppliers only receive an
"eligibility flag", customers need an alternative route for queries about the information held
about them by the DWP. The continuation of the central helpline administered by the DWP wil
ensure that citizens receive the help they are entitled to without having to increase the level of
personal data shared with energy suppliers.
13. Widening the scope of the data matching exercise to other low income customers as well as
those living in the coldest homes is likely to increase the volume of queries, at least in the short
until the new eligibility rules are understood and the datasets have been fully validated. The
helpline will therefore continue to have an important role to play and should be maintained.
14. In addition to the WHD data sharing agreement there is also a separate process that involves the
provision of data matching to delivery agents for the Energy Company Obligation. This is
currently administered by the Energy Saving Trust (EST). This means that installation contractors
and managing agents for delivery of the Home Heating Cost Reduction Obligation can request
householder details to be checked for eligibility. The ability for multiple organisations to request
a data match through EST risks duplication and may already have resulted in more than one
submission of householder details being made to DWP for eligibility-checking. We would
4
propose that obligated parties are considered relevant non-public sector organisations but that
this definition does not apply more widely.
Question 6
Would the provision of energy bill rebates, alongside information about energy efficiency support,
be appropriate forms of assistance to citizens living in fuel poverty?
15. We believe that energy bill rebates alongside energy efficiency advice would be an appropriate
form of assistance to households in fuel poverty. The rebate provides direct support for citizens
to heat their homes during the colder months but it is also important that they understand how
to avoid using more than they need. it is therefore important that households are provided with
advice on how to manage energy use to ensure future energy costs are kept as low as possible.
16. In addition, it would make sense for households automatically eligible for the WHD rebate to also
be eligible for energy efficiency support under ECO or a future supplier obligation scheme. The
focus of these schemes is moving more towards tackling fuel poverty so if households have
already been identified as fuel poor for the purpose of receiving the WHD rebate, they should
also be eligible for energy efficiency support. Taking steps to avoid duplicating eligibility check:s
not only avoids incurring unnecessary costs but also simplifies the process for citizens
17. We believe that restricting the provision of data-matched eligibility information to obligated
suppliers only for the delivery of WHD as well as ECO (and future supplier obligations) will
mitigate the risk of duplicated processes (as described in paragraph 14) and unnecessary
administration costs. As identified in the consultation document, saving on administration costs
will lead to a greater proportion of the budget for the ECO scheme reaching those who need it
most
Question 7
Are there other forms of fuel poverty assistance for citizens that should be considered for inclusion
in the proposed power?
18. As the new proposed principles in the consultation will not seek to replace or amend existing
legislation then we would ask that consideration be given to The Disclosure of State Pension
Credit Information (Warm Home Discount) Regulations 2011. This states that the informatiorn
disclosed to energy suppliers must be used for the purpose of providing a Warm Home Discount
rebate or providing 'relevant assistance'. Relevant assistance is defined as:

targeting of fuel poor households in the future to ensure that support goes to those who need it
most. Doing this cost effectively relies on widening existing data sharing powers, as proposed in
this consultation, to identify low income high cost households through data matching
identifying eligible fuel poor households through data matching will reduce WHD administration
costs considerably, ensuring that more support can reach those who need it most. At the
moment, only pensioner households can be automatically identified for the Core Group, WHD
rebate with other vulnerable customers (the 'Broader Group') needing to apply and be verified
by the energy supplier. In our experience, Broader Group rebates are over thirty times more
expensive to administer than Core Group rebates. Wider data sharing, allowing a greater
proportion of WHD recipients to be automatically matched, will significantly reduce the overal!
administration costs and will increase the cost-effectiveness of the scheme overall.
We therefore support the data sharing proposals to achieve this and the broader principles on
which the changes are based. We also agree that safeguarding the use of the data must be a
priority and that there should be strong sanctions in place to deter misuse of data. However,
government will need to make sure that any sanctions intended to penalise suppliers for
unlawfully sharing data do not unintentionally disadvantage intended WHD recipients.
o We support making WHD Core Group recipients automatically eligible for measures under
supplier obligation schemes. Fuel poor households, by definition, will live in properties that are
costly to keep warm due to being poorly insulated and these are the very homes that supplier
obligation schemes seek to target. Since the primary focus of these schemes in the future will
also be to tackle fuel poverty, then if households have already been identified as fuel poor and
eligible to receive the WHD rebate, it makes practical sense not to require a separate application
process or eligibility check to qualify for energy efficiency measures under a supplier obligation
As a business with considerable experience of completing surveys for the Office of National
Statistics (ONS), we do not feel that the administrative burden or the associated costs are
excessive. We would prefer to retain the ability to provide robust and accurate data ourselves to
the ONS rather this being done through more modern methods of data collection.
We have responded to the questions below that are relevant to E.ON as an obligated supplier
and as a business that submits returns to the ONS. We have not commented on questions
outside of these areas of activity
Improving public service deliver
Question 1
Are there any objectives that you believe should be included in this power that would not meet
these criteria?
1. No comments.
Question 2
Are there any public authorities that you consider would not fit under this definition?
2. No comments.
Question3
Should non-public authorities (such as private companies and charities) that fulfil a public service
function to a public authority be included in the scope of the delivering public services power?
We agree that excluding non-public sector bodies which deliver a public service would limit the
effectiveness of the power. We believe that the power to share data should include non-public
authorities where the delivery of the public service meets the principle objective of the power,
namely to benefit individuals.
3.
. In our capacity as an obligated supplier within the scope of both the WHD and Energy Company
Obligation (ECO) schemes, we are in no doubt that our ability to deliver cost effectively under
future obligated schemes depends upon successful sharing of available data to allow eligible
households to be identified as efficiently as possible. At the same time, we welcome the
proposal that the gateway is permissive, meaning that the public authorities able to use the
power can decide whether or not to disclose data.
4.
Question 4
Are these the correct principles that should be set out in the Code of Practice for this power?
5. Yes, we support all of the principles outlined in paragraph 44· It is vital that data is shared only
for defined purposes and that these are clearly laid out. It is also crucial that safeguards are in
place to prevent the misuse of shared data and that any sanctions for breach of the rules are
robust and effective, but without unintended consequences.
6. We fully agree that no datasets should be shared outside the public sector (paragraph 54) and
that the only information shared between energy suppliers and Government should be ain
"eligibility flag". This would ensure that the Data Protection Act (DPA) 1998 is not weakened irn
any way and that the information provided to energy suppliers is proportionate.
7. We are committed to ensuring we fully adhere to the DPA 1998 and any associated data sharing
regulations and believe these should be strongly enforced. However, we believe that introducing
the power to withhold eligibility information from suppliers, whilst providing a powerful
deterrent against misusing the data, would ultimately disadvantage customers more than energy
suppliers and undermine the key principles this consultation is setting out to achieve.
8. In order to prevent duplicate payments the current automatic data sharing process utilises a
qualifying date. The eligibility flag for any given customer is sent to the energy supplier that
supplied the customer on an agreed date (for scheme year five the date was 12th July 2015)
Excluding one energy supplier from the process would lead to an enormous amount of confusion
for customers who might be unsure whether they need to apply for. the discount or if it will be
provided to them automatically.
9. In addition to the extra cost an energy supplier will incur by trying to identify qualifying
customers, there is also an extremely high likelihood that a proportion of eligible customers will
not contact their energy supplier and therefore miss out on the help that they are entitled to. As
stated in paragraph 46, 'relying on citizens to step forward and apply always results in some
people missing-out'. We would ask that the practical considerations of such a measure be
carefully considered to ensure that any deterrent for misuse of data does not have a detrimental
impact on customers and prevent those most in need from receiving assistance.
Providing assistance to citizens living in fuel povert
Question 5
Should the Government share information with non-public sector organisations as proposed for
the sole purpose of providíng assistance to citizens living in fuel poverty?
10. We believe that the Government should share information with the relevant non-public sector
organisations to provide assistance to households living in fuel poverty. As stated in our
response to question 3, the ability of obligated suppliers to deliver cost effectively under future
obligation schemes depends upon successful sharing of available data to allow eligible
households to be identified as efficiently as possible.
11. A key element of the current data sharing arrangement is the provision of the WHD helpline for
customers with queries about the data matching process. This helpline is administered by the
Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and supports customers who have not beern
automatically matched and therefore need to provide additional information in order to receivie
the WHD rebate
12. We believe it is vital that this service remains in place. As energy suppliers only receive an
"eligibility flag", customers need an alternative route for queries about the information held
about them by the DWP. The continuation of the central helpline administered by the DWP wil
ensure that citizens receive the help they are entitled to without having to increase the level of
personal data shared with energy suppliers.
13. Widening the scope of the data matching exercise to other low income customers as well as
those living in the coldest homes is likely to increase the volume of queries, at least in the short
until the new eligibility rules are understood and the datasets have been fully validated. The
helpline will therefore continue to have an important role to play and should be maintained.
14. In addition to the WHD data sharing agreement there is also a separate process that involves the
provision of data matching to delivery agents for the Energy Company Obligation. This is
currently administered by the Energy Saving Trust (EST). This means that installation contractors
and managing agents for delivery of the Home Heating Cost Reduction Obligation can request
householder details to be checked for eligibility. The ability for multiple organisations to request
a data match through EST risks duplication and may already have resulted in more than one
submission of householder details being made to DWP for eligibility-checking. We would
4
propose that obligated parties are considered relevant non-public sector organisations but that
this definition does not apply more widely.
Question 6
Would the provision of energy bill rebates, alongside information about energy efficiency support,
be appropriate forms of assistance to citizens living in fuel poverty?
15. We believe that energy bill rebates alongside energy efficiency advice would be an appropriate
form of assistance to households in fuel poverty. The rebate provides direct support for citizens
to heat their homes during the colder months but it is also important that they understand how
to avoid using more than they need. it is therefore important that households are provided with
advice on how to manage energy use to ensure future energy costs are kept as low as possible.
16. In addition, it would make sense for households automatically eligible for the WHD rebate to also
be eligible for energy efficiency support under ECO or a future supplier obligation scheme. The
focus of these schemes is moving more towards tackling fuel poverty so if households have
already been identified as fuel poor for the purpose of receiving the WHD rebate, they should
also be eligible for energy efficiency support. Taking steps to avoid duplicating eligibility check:s
not only avoids incurring unnecessary costs but also simplifies the process for citizens
17. We believe that restricting the provision of data-matched eligibility information to obligated
suppliers only for the delivery of WHD as well as ECO (and future supplier obligations) will
mitigate the risk of duplicated processes (as described in paragraph 14) and unnecessary
administration costs. As identified in the consultation document, saving on administration costs
will lead to a greater proportion of the budget for the ECO scheme reaching those who need it
most
Question 7
Are there other forms of fuel poverty assistance for citizens that should be considered for inclusion
in the proposed power?
18. As the new proposed principles in the consultation will not seek to replace or amend existing
legislation then we would ask that consideration be given to The Disclosure of State Pension
Credit Information (Warm Home Discount) Regulations 2011. This states that the informatiorn
disclosed to energy suppliers must be used for the purpose of providing a Warm Home Discount
rebate or providing 'relevant assistance'. Relevant assistance is defined as:

ocrContTitle : C. Allowing use of data for research and for official statistics
Access to identified data which must be linked and de identified using defined processes
for research purposes
Access to more varied and better quality data can provide an improved evidence base
for researchers both within and outside government, leading to better informed
research and more accurate statistics for a range of public benefits. Linking datasets
held by two or more public authorities in a controlled environment offers the opportunity
to gain new insights into the social and economic challenges that citizens and
businesses face. A better understanding of how people live their lives, the patterns of
need and use of different services, and the resultant outcomes would support the
design and delivery of better services
94.
95.
At present researchers are often frustrated in their efforts to access public sector held
data for research projects that have a potential public benefit. Current legislation
causes uncertainty in public authorities as to what information can be disclosed. The
issue of whether disclosing a particular dataset is lawful can lead to lengthy delays and
inconsistent decisions around access. In the meantime, the possible economic or
social benefit from a proposed research project could be lost.
96.
In addition to and not affecting existing data sharing arrangements, new legislation is
proposed to improve conditions for research in two major respects
a. public authorities will have much greater clarity about what data is permitted
to be shared; and
b. information linked under the proposed power will be subject to conditions on
the secure disclosure of data to provide additional assurance to public
authorities, researchers and the public that their data is being used correctly
It requires the use of specific safeguards to ensure that any information that
could be used to identify, or help to identify, an individual (e.g. names, date of
birth and postcode) is de identified through privacy enhancing processes
97.
The 2012 report of the Administrative Data Taskforce (ADT) recommended the use of
an established model to allow for two or more datasets to be linked for research
purposes in a way that minimises the risk of an individual or organisation being
identified. A number of established models are already used by public authorities
These proposals do not intend to replace or amend existing models and arrangements
in place between public authorities, but sets out that data accessed under the
proposed power must be linked using the ADT's recommended model. This
recommended model is referred to as the Trusted Third Party' model. The model was
explored fully during the open policy making discussions in 2014 15, and it was agreed
that access to data should be conditional on the use of such methods
98.
A Trusted Third Party model involves taking two or more different identified datasets,
and removing data that could identify an individual and replacing it with a form of code
or encryption. The resulting de identified data would then be available to researchers to
examine and interrogate in a secure environment. There are several variants of this
model, but many of the steps required to link and de identify. data apply to all
1
Example of how the Trusted Third Party model would work in practice
This example follows the fictitious case of an accredited researcher who is trying to
explore whether there is a relationship between an economic issue and a social
issue. In order to find the evidence necessary to support this project, it is necessary
to link datasets relating to economic factors held by "Department A" with datasets
relating to social factors held by "Department B." Both datasets include records about
the same individuals, including a certain "John Smith." The Trusted Third Party
model allows the researcher to confirm that the "John Smith" whose records are held
by Department A is the same "John Smith" in the dataset held by Department B,
without John Smith's name or any other identifying information (e.g. John Smith's
name, date of birth and National Insurance Number) being disclosed to the
researcher.
Step 1
Department A takes a copy of its dataset, removes the identifying information for
John Smith and replaces this with a unique reference number, XYZ123. This record,
together with any others from which identifying information has been removed and
replaced with reference numbers, becomes the de identified dataset
Department B does the same for its dataset and tags this second de identified
dataset with the unique reference number ABC999 in place of John Smith's
identifying information
Step 2
Department A's identifying information for John Smith (e.g. John Smith's name,
date of birth and National Insurance Number) is placed in a new dataset, the
reference XYZ123 is added, and this dataset, the identity dataset, is sent to an
accredited indexer, the 'trusted third party' who will carry out the next stage of the
próceSS
Department B does the same with its identifying information for John Smith, adding
ABC999 and sending this second identity dataset to the accredited indexer
Step 3
The accredited indexer matches the two identity datasets' records, then confirms
to Department A and to Department B which individual records (including those for
John Smith) it has been able to match
Step 4
Department A sends their de identified dataset (from Step 1) to the accredited
access facility, as does Department B with their de identified dataset
Step 5
The accredited indexer produces a list stating that ABC999 matches with XYZ123
and, having stripped out any identifying information, sends this list, the index, to
the accredited access facility
Step 6
The accredited access facility, using the index and the two de identified datasets
that it has now received from Department A and Department B (amongst which are
the de identified records relating to John Smith), now links the de identified data
together and make this available to the accredited researcher under controlled
conditions
99.
Whilst these proposals have been developed to facilitate the secure linking of personal
data for research purposes, it is not intended that proposals should preclude the
secure processing of data that does not directly identify individuals from this power, for
example property reference data. Further work is being carried out on the inclusion of
such data within the scope of this power.
100. As costs may be incurred by public authorities, indexers and accredited access
facilities in providing data for a research project it is proposed that the new legislation
allows the researcher to be charged a fee to meet the costs. The legislation will specify
that any such fees charged by public authorities are charged on a costs recovery basis
only.
Question fifteen: Should fees be charged by public authorities for providing data for
research purposes, and if so should there be a maximum fee permitted which is
monitored by the UK Statistics Authority?
The cost recovery model will lead to uncertainties for researchers who wish to use such
data.
Fixed costs of linkage may be high but then the marginal cost will be low for any future
researchers using the same data. How will this be incorporated into the pricing
structure? The initial one off fixed cost should not be a barrier to linkage because the
benefits in the long term far outweigh the average cost.
It would be better if there was a fixed transparent cost so that researchers can
incorporate these costs into funding proposals. However, this cost needs to be not so
high to discourage research.
Another model would be for any compensation for upfront costs to be met by a
research body. Ultimately, any costs would be borne by such research bodies anyway
through funding proposals so maybe it would be better to do this directly since this is a
long term investment in a public good.
We would also like to make that point all linkages should be stored securely for future
research projects. This would involve another level of data security and storage issues,
as would entail the third party and the individual data providers storing paired
anonymised identifiers so that matches could be reproduced easily. However, a lot of
effort would be saved in the long run and would keep costs down.
Protective measures specific to this proposed power
101. Through the open policy making process, it was agreed that identified data received
either directly or indirectly by researchers, indexers and others delivering parts of the
process under the power must not then be further disclosed. The legislation ensures
that data from which a person's identity could be deduced is protected and that
disclosure against these conditions would be a criminal offence.
102. It was agreed through the open policy making discussions that all researchers and
bodies involved in the handling of data under the powers meet specified criteria to
show they are fit and proper to fulfil their roles. Therefore, data can only be disclosed if
all the participating bodies and individuals are accredited. As a result it is also
necessary to designate a body to have oversight of the accreditation process.
103. Open policy making discussions concluded that the accreditation body should accredit
the indexers, the researchers, the accredited access facilities and the research itself. It
is proposed that minimum accreditation requirements be set out in primary legislation.
The accreditation body would develop and publish additional detailed standards and
requirements for indexers, researchers and their research, and access facilities to
attain and maintain this accreditation.
104. Key criteria for a suitable accreditation body were discussed as part of the open policy
making process. It was agreed that the accreditation body should have expertise in
statistical research and analysis and be considered fit and proper to exercise the
accreditation process. The view is that the UK Statistics Authority (Statistics Authority)
is the appropriate body to carry out this function.
This needs to be coordinated across all government departments and the UK Data Service so
that accreditation is not duplicated. The full process should not need to be repeated
frequently but refresher courses should be provided.
105. The proposed legislation sets out that the accreditation criteria must be published by
the Statistics Authority together with the grounds for revoking accreditation. Open
policy making discussions concluded that a number of conditions were essential and
needed to be set out in primary legislation. The first condition is that the individual must
be fit and proper to exercise their functions. Secondly, the research question being
explored must be in the public interest. Thirdly, the accreditation body must consult
appropriate experts when establishing and publishing accreditation criteria for
research, researchers, indexers, and access facilities. Finally, the accreditation body
must also maintain and publish a register of accredited researchers, indexers, and
access facilities
Question sixteen: To ensure a consistent approach towards departments accepting or
declining requests for disclosing information for research projects, should the UK
Statistics Authority as the accreditation body publish details of rejected applications
and the reasons for their rejection?
Yes
106. It is proposed that the Statistics Authority can delegate any part of the accreditation
function to other persons or bodies, so long as they meet the requirements set out in
legislation
Power to amend the de identification process
107. Best practices for de identifying data are likely to change over time. The proposed
legislation provides the relevant Minister with a delegated power to modify the
procedures by secondary legislation. Key criteria of the de identification process (such
as the removal of the identity information before it is supplied) will be set out in primary
legislation and sets out that any new procedure can only be made by regulation if it
adheres to those criteria. Furthermore, the proposed legislation sets out that the
Minister must consult the Statistics Authority, Information Commissioner, appropriate
Ministers in the devolved administrations and other persons before making such
regulations
Criteria for determining whether research is in the public interest
108. As strongly recommended by the open policy making group discussions, the illustrative
clauses do not attempt to define "the public interest." Instead, this would be a matter for
the Statistics Authority, as the designated accreditation body to determine. Public
interest will be consistent with the definition of "the public good" for the production and
publication of official statistics set out in the Statistics and Registration Service Act
2007 (which determines the governance and functions of the Statistics Authority). The
Act describes serving the public good as
(a) informing the public about social and economic matters; and
(b) assisting in the development and evaluation of public policy
Question seventeen: What principles or criteria do you think should be used to
identify research that has the potential for public benefit, or research that
will not be in the public benefit?
In an ideal world, the accreditation body would not be the ones to decide whether the
proposed research question is good enough. It will be very difficult for such a process to
be designed in fair and transparent way because it's very difficult to measure or evaluate
public benefit". Accreditation should be about whether the researcher is fit, proper and
trustworthy
However, we recognize that some kind of criteria may be necessary to evaluate the
benefit of the research. We propose that a letter of support from an independent party
such as a government department or a charity would be a good criterion for identifying
research that has the potential for public benefit.

making process. It was agreed that the accreditation body should have expertise in
statistical research and analysis and be considered fit and proper to exercise the
accreditation process. The view is that the UK Statistics Authority (Statistics Authority)
is the appropriate body to carry out this function.
This needs to be coordinated across all government departments and the UK Data Service so
that accreditation is not duplicated. The full process should not need to be repeated
frequently but refresher courses should be provided.
105. The proposed legislation sets out that the accreditation criteria must be published by
the Statistics Authority together with the grounds for revoking accreditation. Open
policy making discussions concluded that a number of conditions were essential and
needed to be set out in primary legislation. The first condition is that the individual must
be fit and proper to exercise their functions. Secondly, the research question being
explored must be in the public interest. Thirdly, the accreditation body must consult
appropriate experts when establishing and publishing accreditation criteria for
research, researchers, indexers, and access facilities. Finally, the accreditation body
must also maintain and publish a register of accredited researchers, indexers, and
access facilities
Question sixteen: To ensure a consistent approach towards departments accepting or
declining requests for disclosing information for research projects, should the UK
Statistics Authority as the accreditation body publish details of rejected applications
and the reasons for their rejection?
Yes
106. It is proposed that the Statistics Authority can delegate any part of the accreditation
function to other persons or bodies, so long as they meet the requirements set out in
legislation
Power to amend the de identification process
107. Best practices for de identifying data are likely to change over time. The proposed
legislation provides the relevant Minister with a delegated power to modify the
procedures by secondary legislation. Key criteria of the de identification process (such
as the removal of the identity information before it is supplied) will be set out in primary
legislation and sets out that any new procedure can only be made by regulation if it
adheres to those criteria. Furthermore, the proposed legislation sets out that the
Minister must consult the Statistics Authority, Information Commissioner, appropriate
Ministers in the devolved administrations and other persons before making such
regulations
Criteria for determining whether research is in the public interest
108. As strongly recommended by the open policy making group discussions, the illustrative
clauses do not attempt to define "the public interest." Instead, this would be a matter for
the Statistics Authority, as the designated accreditation body to determine. Public
interest will be consistent with the definition of "the public good" for the production and
publication of official statistics set out in the Statistics and Registration Service Act
2007 (which determines the governance and functions of the Statistics Authority). The
Act describes serving the public good as
(a) informing the public about social and economic matters; and
(b) assisting in the development and evaluation of public policy
Question seventeen: What principles or criteria do you think should be used to
identify research that has the potential for public benefit, or research that
will not be in the public benefit?
In an ideal world, the accreditation body would not be the ones to decide whether the
proposed research question is good enough. It will be very difficult for such a process to
be designed in fair and transparent way because it's very difficult to measure or evaluate
public benefit". Accreditation should be about whether the researcher is fit, proper and
trustworthy
However, we recognize that some kind of criteria may be necessary to evaluate the
benefit of the research. We propose that a letter of support from an independent party
such as a government department or a charity would be a good criterion for identifying
research that has the potential for public benefit.

Dear Dame Deidre Hine
I understand that you have been appointed to review the NHS response
to the H1N1 Swine Flu outbreak
I am a General Practitioner working in South Birmingham. I have taken
an interest in Pandemic Influenza planning since 2005, and so during
this recent outbreak I kept a record of the impact of H1N1 locally, within
my practice and the local community.
I have enclosed three documents which I hope you may find of interest.
They cover:
1. The impact within my own practice
2. The impact in the local area
3. The role of the patients.
I must apologise as I have tried to email you these documents, but
regrettably have failed in this task.
Kind regards
Dr Philip Morga

HIN1 Pandemic: Northwood/Alvechurch Medical Centres review
HIN1 "Swine flu" emerged in Mexico in February 2009, and spread to
USA, UK, Spain and other countries by March 2009. Locally in the South
Birmingham PCT area the cases appeared from the index school
"Welford Primary School" which is sited in the neighbouring Heart of
Birmingham PCT
During the initial period, protocols were rolled out, updated and changed.
The typical symptomatology needed to be identified and for this
information to be disseminated to the frontline health care workers.
Initially patients and immediate family were treated actively and
prophylatically, a limited number of HPA swabs were available for
confirmation, the weekly HPA bulletin was not available, and the
National Pandemic Flu line was not available until July 2009.
The following data has been collated from the EMIS consultation
software used by Northwood and Alvechurch Medical Centres (NMC
TRS and NMC ILI), together with RCGP/HPA/QFLU data when these
became available.
(Notes: An increased level is described as an ILI rate greater than 30, the
winter of 2008 was the worst recent winter for 8 years prior to the winter
of 2009, and the registered population in the practice at this time was
approximately 9000 patients)
The first wave
The first cases appeared in the second week of April and the first wave
officially ended in the last week of August, a total of 19 weeks. During
this period the peak "Influenza like illness "(ILI) rate reached 273, 3.3
times higher than the peak ILI rate of 2008 (81) and a total of 138
patients were coded as having either "influenza", " suspected swine flu"
or "swine flu".
A review of these patients identified:
0-5-12

16-64-95
65+=6
Male-49
Female-89
·
The female 25 to 54 was the commonest demographic group
32% of those infected had known chronic medical conditions
There was a hiatus of six weeks. During this time, the doctors would
regularly consult in excess of 80 patients per day, with a peak
consultation rate of 108 patients seen in one day by one doctor.
The second wave
The second wave commenced in the second week of October and
officially ended at the end of 2009 although the Christmas/new year
period did produce a skew in data. During this period the peak ILI rate
was 174, 2.15 times the peak of 2008 and a total of 118 patients were
coded as having "influenza" "suspected swine flu" or "swine flu"

Dear Dame Deidre Hine
I understand that you have been appointed to review the NHS response
to the H1N1 Swine Flu outbreak
I am a General Practitioner working in South Birmingham. I have taken
an interest in Pandemic Influenza planning since 2005, and so during
this recent outbreak I kept a record of the impact of H1N1 locally, within
my practice and the local community.
I have enclosed three documents which I hope you may find of interest.
They cover:
1. The impact within my own practice
2. The impact in the local area
3. The role of the patients.
I must apologise as I have tried to email you these documents, but
regrettably have failed in this task.
Kind regards
Dr Philip Morga

HIN1 Pandemic: Northwood/Alvechurch Medical Centres review
HIN1 "Swine flu" emerged in Mexico in February 2009, and spread to
USA, UK, Spain and other countries by March 2009. Locally in the South
Birmingham PCT area the cases appeared from the index school
"Welford Primary School" which is sited in the neighbouring Heart of
Birmingham PCT
During the initial period, protocols were rolled out, updated and changed.
The typical symptomatology needed to be identified and for this
information to be disseminated to the frontline health care workers.
Initially patients and immediate family were treated actively and
prophylatically, a limited number of HPA swabs were available for
confirmation, the weekly HPA bulletin was not available, and the
National Pandemic Flu line was not available until July 2009.
The following data has been collated from the EMIS consultation
software used by Northwood and Alvechurch Medical Centres (NMC
TRS and NMC ILI), together with RCGP/HPA/QFLU data when these
became available.
(Notes: An increased level is described as an ILI rate greater than 30, the
winter of 2008 was the worst recent winter for 8 years prior to the winter
of 2009, and the registered population in the practice at this time was
approximately 9000 patients)
The first wave
The first cases appeared in the second week of April and the first wave
officially ended in the last week of August, a total of 19 weeks. During
this period the peak "Influenza like illness "(ILI) rate reached 273, 3.3
times higher than the peak ILI rate of 2008 (81) and a total of 138
patients were coded as having either "influenza", " suspected swine flu"
or "swine flu".

There was a hiatus of six weeks. During this time, the doctors would
regularly consult in excess of 80 patients per day, with a peak
consultation rate of 108 patients seen in one day by one doctor.
The second wave
The second wave commenced in the second week of October and
officially ended at the end of 2009 although the Christmas/new year
period did produce a skew in data. During this period the peak ILI rate
was 174, 2.15 times the peak of 2008 and a total of 118 patients were
coded as having "influenza" "suspected swine flu" or "swine flu"

Dear Simon
REVIEW OF THE RESPONSE TO THE 2009 INFLUENZA PANDEMIC: CALL FOR
EVIDENCE
Thank you for your letter of 12 March seeking relevant papers and comments to aid your
review. I was appointed on 27 April 2009 by the FCO's Permanent Under Secretary to lead
and coordinate the FCO's overall response to the H1N1 influenza outbreak. The comments
below represent a collective FCO response to your letter but I have concentrated on your
Containment question 14 relating to travel advice policy for which the FCO is directly
responsible, and on key lessons learned
ravel Advice Polic
FCO travel advice policy is based on the safety of British nationals overseas. This is a
paramount concern for the FCO. We attach great importance to providing information about
personal safety and security overseas to enable people to make informed decisions about
travel. This policy did not change during our response to the H1N1 pandemic. While it
seemed to be clear at the outset that the outbreak was not avian flu nor yet a pandemic, the
FCO based its initial wider response on plans we had developed for such a scenario based
on two principles, that: (i) we will seek to maintain services to the public as far as we can,
and (ii) we will exercise our duty of care to our staff as far as we can. Those plans aligned
travel advice levels with the WHO alert levels. Throughout the response we coordinated
closely with key EU and Colloque (Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the US) partners
and maintained a close relationship with British tour operators through the Federation of
Tour Operators (FTO) and the travel association ABTA
On Friday 24 April and Sunday 26 April, before central government coordination
mechanisms were activated, the FCO factually updated its travel advice for Mexico to alert
travellers to the flu outbreak, to precautionary health measures and to advise those
developing flu-like symptoms to seek medical advice
On Monday 27 April the FCO set up a cross-FCO Flu Crisis Unit to dock with the Civil
Contingencies Committee, staff FCO-wide activity and coordinate with our overseas posts
Later the same day, still following our developed plans as explained in para 2 above
Ministers agreed - following the WHO's decision to raise the global pandemic alert level to 4
to raise the level of travel advice for Mexico to advise against all but essential travel and to
advise those British nationals in Mexico to consider whether they should remain. At the
same time, and in line with our developed plans, we agreed to curtail public services
operated from our Embassy in Mexico City, and on 28 April we agreed to limit work at our
Embassy to essential work only including support for distressed British nationals. We
offered non-essential UK based staff the option of returning voluntarily to the UK (we also
extended this offer to staff without an urgent need to remain in Belize and Guatemala (which
border Mexico to the South and have poor health infrastructure)). Both these decisions were
also in line with decisions being taken by our key international consular partners. We also
set up a dedicated Swine Flu page on the FCO's website to give generic advice to members
of the public, and issued guidance to our network of overseas posts covering business
continuity, duty of care to staff and on reporting requirements. (From 30 April we added a
generic paragraph to all our country specific travel advice pages providing general advice
and links to our dedicated swine flu page, and the Dept of Health (DH) and WHO websites.)
Since raising our travel advice level for Mexico on 27 April it became clear that our
developed pandemic plans were too rigid, too tightly linked to the WHO global pandemic
level alerts and therefore no longer completely useful as an effective tool to guide and trigger
our travel advice changes. The level changes would have been disproportionate to the risk
to travellers. Therefore on 29 April, when WHO raised its global threat level to 5, in line with
Health Protection Agency (HPA) and the National Travel Health Network and Centre
(NaTHNaC) advice and in line with key international partners we delinked the automatic
raising of travel advice levels, and sought further advice from the HPA, NaTHNaC, and the
Dept for Transport (DfT) about how best we might inform our travel advice decision making
to provide practical, objective, accurate and up-to-date advice for British nationals
After consulting with HPA, NaTHNaC and DfT we reviewed the criteria for further level
changes to our travel advice, and agreed that further changes would be considered on a
country-by-country basis in accordance with criteria set out below. An FCO led working
group with HPA, NaTHNaC and DfT would review information received from Posts, Whitehall
partners and WHO according to this criteria. The decision on levels of travel advice would
remain with the FCO. We communicated this new guidance to our network of oversea:s
posts on 1 May. CCC (O) and later CCC(M) formally agreed the new criteria for raising travel
advice on 2 May. The criteria are
available information on the source and cause of the outbreak, and the pattern of its
travel within the local population, (i.e. its epidemiology);
the number of confirmed cases of swine influenza
the functionality and severity of confirmed cases (i.e. whether predominantly mild, or
resulting in a proportionally significant number of severe cases or fatalities);
the quality, resilience and availability of local healthcare services for dealing with the
outbreak, and availability of antiviral medication
In line with advice from HPA, non-essential staff at our Embassy in Mexico City returned to
work on 7 May and public services were re-opened on 11 May. We lowered our travel
advice level for Mexico on 15 May in line with HPA advice and our key international consular
partners
The annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in November 2009, occurring some six months after
the initial outbreak provided the FCO with a number of challenges. It was clear from an early
stage that the majority of Pilgrims would not cancel their plans due to the outbreak. Also
given that the pandemic had spread worldwide by this stage, there seemed little justification
in advising against travel. Instead, we decided that the proportionate response would be to
amend FCO travel advice to highlight the WHO and Saudi government advice (that the over
65s, under 12s and those with chronic diseases should abstain from that year's Ha. The
DH agreed. Pilgrims could then make an informed decision about whether to attend. The
DH also drafted detailed health advice that was agreed by CCC(M)
Overseas Territories
The Overseas Territories (OTs) are a UK government-wide responsibility. The FCO leads
overall policy with other Government departments leading and supporting the territories on
areas within their responsibilities. While most powers, including provision of healthcare, are
devolved to the territories, the UK retains responsibility for good governance, defence and
external relations. HMG is ultimately responsible for fulfilling international obligations
applying to the territories and for meeting contingent liabilities that arise from emergencies
(such as a swine flu pandemic) and disasters in the territories. The UK has given a firm
commitment to assist the territories in emergencies
Although the OTs activated their own pandemic preparedness plans to contain suspected
cases, monitor ports, and educate the public on hygiene practices, aside from Gibraltar
none of them had sufficient supplies of clinical countermeasures for their populations
They do not have the resources to keep stocks of medication for contingencies. They also
found it difficult to gain access to anti-virals and vaccines at short notice from commercial
suppliers for their relatively small populations and looked to the UK for assistance. After
some delay due to a lack of awareness by departments of their responsibility for the
OTs, CCC(O) agreed on 14 May 2009 that the DH would provide anti-virals and vaccines to
the OTs on a cost recovery basis. Many appreciative territories took up this provision
Lessons Learned
While learning a number of lessons from the cross-FCO response, l've concentrated here on
the key ones most pertinent to this review
On travel advice, it became clear very early on in our response that the developed plans we
had in place were predicated on a more deadly, fast moving Avian flu pandemic and as such
were not strictly fit for purpose. Furthermore, WHO had advised against restricting travel
As a resuit we have revised our generic contingency planning delinking travel advice level
changes from WHO global pandemic threat levels, and making them more flexible. One key
addition is the inclusion of the Travel Advisory Working Group (FCO, HPA, DfT, NaTHNac)
as an invaluable tool to handle future responses. We also learned the value of consultation
with the HPA/DH to ensure consistency between travel advice policy and national policy of
"containment" during the different phases of an emerging pandemic. Staying in close stejp
with key international consular partners, and gaining a better understanding of their travel
advice plans in a pandemic is another worthwhile lesson
Cross-government working operated well. Cabinet Office activated their response
mechanisms quickly. We were particularly pleased to have an FCO representative in the
International Cell, though access to FCO IT (i.e. a Firecrest terminal) at the CCS offices in
Great Smith Street would have helped communication
Other government departments need to bear in mind that a pandemic outbreak has
implications for the UK's Overseas Territories as well as the UK and that all government
departments are responsible for the OTs within their area of expertise. In the event of
a pandemic the UK would likely be required to take both operational and legislative action in
relation to the OTs and this should be factored into the UK's overall planning strategy. The
DH and the Cabinet Office need to engage the FCO and DfID at an early stage to factor in
the OTs to any contingency planning and particularly when negotiating contracts with
medical suppliers
CCS should have copies of all our key relevant documents (including guidance eGrams to
posts, and papers provided for CCC(O) and (M)). 1 also attach here for information a copy of
a submission to our PUS dated 17 June 2009 recommending sustainable arrangements
within the FCO to manage pandemic flu workload and key lessons learned across our
organisation
The FCO of course stands ready to assist the Review team with any further questions you
might have including on wider international or foreign policy-related issues

INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF THE GOVERNMENT RESPONSE
TO THE 2009 H1N1 PANDEMIC
Thank you for inviting me to take part in the Independent Review of
Government Response to the H1N1 Pandemic. In my role as Government
Chief Scientific Adviser and as co-Chair of the Scientific Advisory Group for
Emergencies (SAGE) I took a very active part in the Government response
and I hope my thoughts will further improve Government's already excellent
contingency planning for future pandemics
I understand the Department of Health will address many of the factual
questions you posed in your letter, therefore I will keep my comments
focussed more generally on what went well and areas which could be
addressed for further improvement. I will of course be happy to speak to all
of these, and any other questions, in more detail when we meet in person
I should first of all say that thought the government response to the
pandemic was good, the time and effort spent on developing pre-pandemic
contingency plans (e.g. stockpiling of antiviral drugs) was justified and allowed
a measured and proportionate response to what fortunately turned out to be
a milder version of pandemic influenza than could have been. There are of
course always areas that can be improved, therefore please find my thoughts
below

» The existing peacetime Scientific AdvisoryGroup on Pandemic
Influenza (SPI) Committee provided an excellent base from which to
draw expertise into SAGE. These experts were already familiar with
pre-pandemic planning and the relevant issues on which advice was
ikely to be required. It would be useful to consider if other
independent scientific advisory committees might fulfil similar roles for
other areas of civil contingency planning
Similarly having an independent co-Chair of SAGE, Prof Sir Gordon Duff
who had previously chaired SPl, provided continuity from the pre
pandemic work. This greatly assisted me and added significant value
to the chairmanship, particularly when discussing certain detailed
scientific issues. Having co-Chairs also allowed some degree of
flexibility in taking decisions on behalf of SAGE when one or other was
not available (given the time pressures faced during a pandemic)
Again, this might be a useful model to consider for future occasions
when SAGE is activated
. The secretariat to SAGE (and its sub-committees) worked extremely
hard throughout the pandemic and deserve particular praise in the
quality of service they delivered throughout. Given the length of the
pandemic and the time requirements, extra resource to this activity
would have helped reduce long-term pressure and stress on those
committed individuals (and perhaps help strengthen linkages with DH
policy, see below)
. SAGE had a remit to advise Government and Devolved Administrations
(DAs) through the Ministerial CCC by providing regular updates and
answering specific questions. Much of the SAGE advice fed directly
into Department of Health (DH) policy development which was also
subsequently discussed at CCC. This worked well (particularly given
this was the first time a SAGEhad been convened in a civil
contingencies situation), however, there wasn't always a clearly
structured or fully transparent way in which this was done. Therefore
a more structured approach in how DH policy engaged with SAGE
(particularly in a fast changing environment) would benefit all parties in
ensuring advice on relevant issues was provided at the most
appropriate time
. The route for scientific advice into the other key Ministerial forum, the
Four Nation Health Ministers group, was less clear. This group
undoubtedly fulfilled a useful role in allowing all administrations to fully
discuss policy issues; however, there were some discussions on
issues requiring scientific advice. The limited attendance at these
meetings meant SAGE was not directly involved in providing advice
2
There was therefore a lack of clarity in how scientific advice was
presented and in what context. Although such scientific advice
provided might have been perfectly appropriate, there was a clear lack
of transparency which should be addressed
. Earlier this year SAGE undertook a lessons learned exercise, which
identified a number of areas to work on (and which SPI sub
committees are already acting on). One particular area flagged up was
that Ministers and senior officials often expected SAGE (or HPA) to be
able to provide more information and more certainty on scientific
evidence than was possible; in particular on modelling projections for
the future of the pandemic. In the first 1-3 months epidemiological
data is often insufficient to base 'accurate' predictions, and at best
modellers can show a range of possible scenarios including the
possible 'worst-case'. Only as a pandemic progresses and more data
becomes available can epidemiologists, modellers and virologists begin
to revise the scenarios and have more certainty on predictions.
Therefore certain decisions must be taken in the face of limited
scientific evidence, for example the decision on the purchase of
vaccines was taken at a time when there was still a considerable range
of potential scenarios for the pandemic. Although the uncertainties in
the data could be explained at CCC meetings, emphasising what could
and couldn't be expected, I still sensed a feeling of frustration at the
lack of certainty. It is understandable to want more scientific certainty
in civil contingency situations, and this is not a criticism; however there
is definitely a need to work on managing the expectations of Ministers
and senior officials for future pandemics, and develop tools to explain
the intrinsic uncertainties in scientific evidence (and this work should
include modellers and epidemiologists to try to find the right balance)
As mentioned above, when to purchase vaccine and how much was
clearly an important decision early on in the pandemic. The options for
different levels of vaccine coverage and whether to wait for more
information on the virus before ordering were discussed at both JCVI
and SAGE. Previous analysis had shown that a 45-50% population
coverage would have significant impact on the pandemic from an
epidemiological perspective. However, both JCVI and SAGE advised
that, given the level of uncertainty in information on the disease at the
time and the time required to develop, manufacture and licence a
vaccine, an immediate decision to purchase should be made. The level
of uncertainty on the severity and impact of the new H1N1 strain,
suggested purchasing 100% coverage for the whole population, based
on an expected two dose regime, would be the prudent course.
The intense media interest during the pandemic put significant
pressure on Government. The media were keen to have 'accurate'
predictions for the pandemic, but when provided with the 'worst-case
planning assumptions; the first revision of which gave possible deaths
of up to 65,000 there was much speculation of government
overreaction. Even though this figure was reduced from the 750,000
deaths used for pre-pandemic planning, and was further reduced twice
more as the understanding of the epidemiology of the disease became
clearer, the issue of 'worst-case' predictions was largely
misunderstood or misinterpreted. The 'worst-case figures were
arrived at by multiplying the 'worst-case' for every parameter together
The worst-case' figures therefore represented an extremely unlikely
outcome. This approach arose from the way in which each of the
different parameters were presented separately in the early versions of
the planning assumption document. Clearly, the planning assumptions
contain important information for contingency planners, and was not
originally intended to be a public document, however a more careful
presentation and derivation of a reasonable 'worst-case' scenario
would be beneficial in future.
As reflected in recent media articles on this issue, there is work to be
done in educating the media and the public, and learning how best to
communicate scientific uncertainty and the difference between 'worst-
case' scenarios, and broad ranges of predictions. understand these
thoughts are also echoed in the Department of Health memorandum
. It should also be highlighted that while in general SAGE members
were in agreement about their analysis of the pandemic, and in their
recommendations, this can not be guaranteed. For example it was not
possible to form a consensus opinion on whether antiviral treatment
should continue be given to all patients or if this should be limited to
only those individuals in the defined 'at-risk' groups. The majority view
was that of providing treatment to 'at-risk' groups (with additional
clinical discretion) rather than to all, however the discussion was finely
balanced. The lack of a complete consensus was clearly
communicated to CCC and it was made clear that the advice given
was based on the weight of scientific opinion. However, the lack of a
consensus amongst SAGE members caused a delay in taking policy
decisions because of the perceived 'scientific uncertainty'. Clearly in
situations where scientific evidence is unclear or incomplete there are
going to be times when scientists will not agree, but this is precisely
the reason why independent scientific scrutiny is necessary to
challenge the existing evidence. This again highlights the need to
consider how best to communicate scientific evidence toMinisters
and senior officials, in particular at times when policy decisions need to
4
be made in the absence of agreement amongst the scientific
community
. Given the internal and external pressures faced by government during
an emergency situation there is an inevitable desire for new scientific
data to be analysed and disseminated as quickly as possible. During
the swine flu pandemic, the battle rhythm that was established meant
that data from HPA, provided in their regular situation report, was
discussed by Ministers and communicated to the public often on the
same day, not leaving time for independent scrutiny through SAGE
This led to some SAGE members concern at the way in which data
was being presented to the public (or at least a lack of clarity as to the
context in which some data was presented). For future civil
contingencies events some more thought should be put into the battle
rhythm that is established; while accepting that there is an inevitable
way in which Ministerial agendas/timetables are forced by events,
there is equally an important need to leave time for scientific data to be
analysed before wider dissemination, particularly in events such as
disease outbreaks where the scientific evidence base is a slowly
evolving process
. There has also been some comment about the different surveillance
systems in place in the different administrations during the pandemic
This meant extra time was required to interpret the differences
between the data, however, where one administration had more
detailed data, or a different interpretation on data in a particular area
this provided useful comparisons on which to assess the epidemiology
of the disease. Generally the different systems didn't hinder the
response to the pandemic, and the level of data collected was of
excellent quality. However, to continue to improve in this area
consideration should be given to the surveillance data required in a
pandemic, and examine which administrations systems were able to
capture certain information the best, and see how this might be
applied across all administrations (acknowledging operational
differences)
To address one particular surveillance data issue, a key data set
required to develop the full epidemiological picture is that of deaths
On this occasion the CMO did a meticulous job in looking into all H1N1
related deaths to assess the true mortality figures. However, such
investigations were not undertaken in devolved administrations, thus
leading to differences in reported mortality rates between the
administrations. This lead to some uncertainty in SAGE, and the
modelling sub-committee, with no real way to resolve the issue in real
time. This specific point should be addressed for future pandemics.

Introduction
This document takes a view on the possible course of events in the development of the H1N1
influenza ("Swine Flu") outbreak over the next 12 months. t represents the views of a number of
technical experts in the field of influenza epidemiology and social sciences. This is not intended as
a prediction, rather a scenario against which we can make advance plans.
This document replaces Issue 1 dated 11 May 2009 and will be updated at intervals to reflect
current circumstances and changing advice and guidance.
1.1 Technical Terms
This document uses the following technical descriptions relating to infectious diseases:
Clinical Attack Rate (CAR) Percentage of the whole population who become infected at some
stage during the pandemic, not al of whom will exhibit significant symptoms
Case Fatality Rate (CFR) Percentage of those who become ill who subsequently die as a
direct result of the illness.
Excess Mortality the number of additional deaths in the population caused by the disease
Note that the World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a pandemic as a disease that affects more
than 25% of the world's population over the course of the outbreak which could be 12-18 months
in the case of an influenza outbreak.
12 Expressing Probability
All descriptions of possible future events are presented with an indication of confidence, using the
expressions of probability listed in Table 1-1; they are set in bold upper case text. Owing to the
high number of variables, not least in the operation of chance and the interventions of human
beings, trends-based analysis can never offer precise predictive analysis and these terms provide
an indication of confidence based on the available evidence and an assessment of the risk.

Disease Development
2.1 Current Situation
The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared a pandemic Phase 4 alert on 27 April 2009
followed by a Phase 5 alert on 29 April and subsequently a Phase 6 Alert on 11 June. These
alerts were based on the revised definition of the pandemic alert phases issued in early April 2009
which substantially reduced the alert criteria from those that had been in existence for some time
and against which most national contingency plans (and Serco's Contingency Plan) had been
developed. The resut of this change has been to raise the alert level much earlier in the
development of the disease in terms of its geographic spread and its severity.
The current WHO alert level is Phase 6 indicating community level outbreaks across more than
one WHO region. There are now confirmed cases in the majority of countries across the world
with significant outbreaks in the USA, Canada and the UK and increasing numbers of cases being
reported in South America, Australia and a number of counties in South-East Asia
2.2
Possible Course of Development
1.1.1
Most Likely Scenario
With the number of confirmed and possible cases in a large number of countries and with human-
to-human transmission verified, it is VERY LIKELY that there will be continue to be large numbers
of new cases confirmed in countries where the disease is already confirmed and in other countries
which have not yet had identified cases. Currently, the disease is classed as "mild" and many of
the various Government's contingency measures planned to be introduced at the Phase 6 level of
alert have not been implemented, at least not currently, because of the mild nature of the disease
for the majority of those infected.
Figure 2-1 shows the POSSIBLE profile for the current H1N1 influenza outbreak which has taken
the mortality impact of the 1918 19 H1N1 "Spanish flu" outbreak in the UK with current dates
superimposed assuming a starting date of the end of May 2009 for significant pandemic activity. If
the current outbreak of H1N1 influenza follows the same course of events in the UK as the 1918/
19 outbreak which killed 20 40 M people world-wide, there will VERY LIKELY be a "first wave" of
infections lasting up to 8 weeks (May end June 2009) causing only mild illness and affecting a
small percentage of populations. This is LIKELY to be followed by a "second wave" of more
severe illness that MAY commence in late September 2009 and MAY last until mid-December
2009. This MAY be followed almost immediately by a "third wave" in the period mid January
late-March 2010 before the pandemic outbreak subsides
It is LIKELY that a similar profile will be followed in most developed countries, although timings of
the peaks and the mortality rates are LIKELY to be different. In lesser developed countries
including India and China, the pandemic profile MAY follow this profile, but this is very uncertain

It is considered POSSIBLE that the virus will mutate as it spreads across the human and animal
populations, with a POSSIBLE scenario being that it acquires the characteristics of the H5N1 avian
influenza strain as the current outbreak affects significant number of the populations of South-East
Asia and China.
It is currently considered PROBABLE that a "second wave" of the pandemic caused by a mutated
virus will occur in Europe and North America in late autumn and early winter 2009, coinciding with
the beginning of the seasonal flu period. If it occurs, it is LIKELY that this second wave will be
have a much greater rate of infection, cause a more severe illness and cause a significant number
of deaths. The POSSIBLE disease characteristics for the "second wave" in the UK are shown in
Table 2-2 although there is substantial uncertainty at this stage. These figures are comparable to
the 1957 pandemic
Table 2 2

Given the start of a mass-vaccination programme in September 2009 in the UK, Europe and North
America, it is considered UNLIKELY that there will be a significant third wave of infection in these
regions
1.1.2 Alternative Scenario
The alternative scenario where this outbreak of H1N1 influenza quickly diminishes and does not
subsequently reappear is, at present, considered UNLIKELY

Introduction
This document takes a view on the possible course of events in the development of the H1N1
influenza ("Swine Flu") outbreak over the next 12 months. t represents the views of a number of
technical experts in the field of influenza epidemiology and social sciences. This is not intended as
a prediction, rather a scenario against which we can make advance plans.
This document replaces Issue 1 dated 11 May 2009 and will be updated at intervals to reflect
current circumstances and changing advice and guidance.
1.1 Technical Terms
This document uses the following technical descriptions relating to infectious diseases:
Clinical Attack Rate (CAR) Percentage of the whole population who become infected at some
stage during the pandemic, not al of whom will exhibit significant symptoms
Case Fatality Rate (CFR) Percentage of those who become ill who subsequently die as a
direct result of the illness.
Excess Mortality the number of additional deaths in the population caused by the disease
Note that the World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a pandemic as a disease that affects more
than 25% of the world's population over the course of the outbreak which could be 12-18 months
in the case of an influenza outbreak.
12 Expressing Probability
All descriptions of possible future events are presented with an indication of confidence, using the
expressions of probability listed in Table 1-1; they are set in bold upper case text. Owing to the
high number of variables, not least in the operation of chance and the interventions of human
beings, trends-based analysis can never offer precise predictive analysis and these terms provide
an indication of confidence based on the available evidence and an assessment of the risk.

Disease Development
2.1 Current Situation
The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared a pandemic Phase 4 alert on 27 April 2009
followed by a Phase 5 alert on 29 April and subsequently a Phase 6 Alert on 11 June. These
alerts were based on the revised definition of the pandemic alert phases issued in early April 2009
which substantially reduced the alert criteria from those that had been in existence for some time
and against which most national contingency plans (and Serco's Contingency Plan) had been
developed. The resut of this change has been to raise the alert level much earlier in the
development of the disease in terms of its geographic spread and its severity.
The current WHO alert level is Phase 6 indicating community level outbreaks across more than
one WHO region. There are now confirmed cases in the majority of countries across the world
with significant outbreaks in the USA, Canada and the UK and increasing numbers of cases being
reported in South America, Australia and a number of counties in South-East Asia
2.2
Possible Course of Development
1.1.1
Most Likely Scenario
With the number of confirmed and possible cases in a large number of countries and with human-
to-human transmission verified, it is VERY LIKELY that there will be continue to be large numbers
of new cases confirmed in countries where the disease is already confirmed and in other countries
which have not yet had identified cases. Currently, the disease is classed as "mild" and many of
the various Government's contingency measures planned to be introduced at the Phase 6 level of
alert have not been implemented, at least not currently, because of the mild nature of the disease
for the majority of those infected.
Figure 2-1 shows the POSSIBLE profile for the current H1N1 influenza outbreak which has taken
the mortality impact of the 1918 19 H1N1 "Spanish flu" outbreak in the UK with current dates
superimposed assuming a starting date of the end of May 2009 for significant pandemic activity. If
the current outbreak of H1N1 influenza follows the same course of events in the UK as the 1918/
19 outbreak which killed 20 40 M people world-wide, there will VERY LIKELY be a "first wave" of
infections lasting up to 8 weeks (May end June 2009) causing only mild illness and affecting a
small percentage of populations. This is LIKELY to be followed by a "second wave" of more
severe illness that MAY commence in late September 2009 and MAY last until mid-December
2009. This MAY be followed almost immediately by a "third wave" in the period mid January
late-March 2010 before the pandemic outbreak subsides
It is LIKELY that a similar profile will be followed in most developed countries, although timings of
the peaks and the mortality rates are LIKELY to be different. In lesser developed countries
including India and China, the pandemic profile MAY follow this profile, but this is very uncertain

It is considered POSSIBLE that the virus will mutate as it spreads across the human and animal
populations, with a POSSIBLE scenario being that it acquires the characteristics of the H5N1 avian
influenza strain as the current outbreak affects significant number of the populations of South-East
Asia and China.
It is currently considered PROBABLE that a "second wave" of the pandemic caused by a mutated
virus will occur in Europe and North America in late autumn and early winter 2009, coinciding with
the beginning of the seasonal flu period. If it occurs, it is LIKELY that this second wave will be

Proposed merger of 21st Century Fox, Inc and Sky plc
Thank you for your letter of 31 August 2017 requesting further clarification from Ofcom in
accordance with s.106B(2) of the Enterprise Act 2002 on our letter dated 25 August 2017.
Question 1
You asked whether, considering all the relevant evidence, including our review of the further
relevant representations, it is Ofcom's view that:
(a) the legal threshold for a reference is not met (i.e. there are no non-fanciful concerns in
relation to the commitment to broadcasting standards ground) such that the Secretary of
State has no power to make a reference in relation to that ground; or
(b) the legal threshold for a reference is met (i.e. there are non-fanciful concerns in relation
to the commitment to broadcasting standards ground) such that the Secretary of State has
the power to make a reference in relation to that ground, but Ofcom considers that she
should exercise her discretion so as not to make a reference
You asked Ofcom specifically to identify the non-fanciful concerns referred to on page 6 of
our letter.
As you recognise, we noted in page 6 of our letter that we did consider there are non-fancifut
concerns in relation to the merger. Our advice, as the broadcast regulator, was that while we
consider there are non-fanciful concerns, we do not consider that these are such as may
justify a reference in relation to the broadcast standards public interest consideration. In
reaching this view, we placed particular weight on the incentives established by the
existence of the statutory framework for broadcast standards regulation, involving an upfront
commitment to compliance through licencing requirements and ex post protection of the
public interest in broadcasting standards through a sanctions regime, and considered this
together with the parties' history of compliance1. We also recognised that the Secretary of
Ofcom's role in the case is to report on the effect of the public interest considerations on the case, giving
advice and recommendations on any media public interest consideration you specified which is or may be
relevant to the Secretary of State's decision as to whether to make a reference.

State has discretion as to whether to judge that there are any non-fanciful concerns and if
there are - whether these warrant a reference, taking appropriate account of our advice
The non-fanciful concerns are those we identified as concerns in our letter: Fox News lacked
adequate procedures for broadcast compliance in the UK - but new, satisfactory procedures
were put in place. And there were alleged corporate failings, which did not take place in a
broadcasting standards context. However, in considering these concerns in relation to the
broadcast standards consideration, our approach is that something in the nature of the
corporate governance concern has to give rise to an identifiable risk in terms of UK
broadcast standards compliance
Our previous letter also addressed a number of programme items drawn to the Secretary of
State's attention and we have reported that none of them raised issues which would warrant
opening an investigation. However, we did not consider we could reach a view on wider
issues raised by the Seth Rich case, given the developing nature of the story, and noted that
our fit and proper assessment is an ongoing duty and would take account of any relevart
evidence that emerges.
Question 2
In relation to Fox's corporate governance arrangements, you asked to what extent Ofcom
investigated how the new arrangements put in place in 2012 have worked in practice,
including how effectively they have operated? What evidence did Ofcom consider on this
point, and what (if any) conclusions did it reach (and why)?
As you noted in your letter to us of 7 August 2017, many of the representations made to you
on Fox's corporate govermance relate to Ofcom's assessment of whether Sky would remairn
fit and proper to hold its broadcast licences following the merger. You asked us to comment
insofar as those matters impact upon our findings on the commitment to broadcasting
standards. As set out above, our approach in doing so is that something in the nature of a
non-broadcasting corporate governance concern has to give rise to an identifiable risk in
terms of broadcast standards compliance
A statutory regime exists for securing broadcast standards compliance including sanctions
establishing a framework which incentivises an upfront commitment to compliance through
licensing requirements and provides ongoing ex post protection for the public interest in the
attainment of broadcast standards
We considered Fox's general corporate governance arrangements and its history, and the
representations put to us by third parties making allegations of non-broadcast failures of
corporate governance. However, in advising you on the broadcasting standards public
interest consideration, we considered it right to focus principally on broadcast standards
compliance procedures. We looked at the broadcast standards procedures and the
compliance history of all the licensed Fox subsidiaries. When we found procedures which we
considered to be inadequate, at Fox News, we asked a series of detailed questions of Fox,
which included questions about how (practically) the procedures would apply, and we
secured the establishment of arrangements which we considered demonstrated a
commitment to the attainment of broadcast standards
Page 2 of3
Question 3
You noted our conclusion that: "We have considered broadcasting compliance primarily by
reference to complaints and we believe this to be an effective and proportionate approach'.
You asked us to explain the basis for this, i.e. why we consider this approach to be effective
and proportionate
As set out in our letter to you, we do undertake targeted monitoring of services and in fact
we monitored Fox News during the 2017 UK election period. The compliance record
considered in our report to you captured this period of monitoring. In other words, we did
what the representations to you suggested we should do.
n our letter to you, we also included an assessment of the analysis of recent output by Fox
News in the UK put to you in representations as examples of problematic content which had
not generated complaints at the time. As you will have seen from our letter (Annex 1) and foir
the reasons set out there, none of the 10 instances raised any issues which we would
consider warrant us opening an investigation. In other words, we consider that complaints
effectively identified problematic content and that the concerns raised by representations
that we mayhave missed relevant evidence by adoptina this apprpach were not borne out.

What is the problem under consideration? Why is government intervention necessary?
In the Future Partnership Paper, the government set out two ambitious approaches which most closely meet its
objectives for the UK's future outside of the EU Customs Union. The Future Partnership Paper also explained that,
regardless of the outcome of these negotiations, the UK will need to legislate for a new customs regime to be in place
by March 2019 that can give effect to whatever arrangements are agreed with its European partners, including an
interim period. The UK will also need to legislate for a new customs regime if there is no negotiated settlement. In
addition, whatever the outcome of the negotiations, the UK will need to make changes to the cross-border rules for the
VAT and excise regimes, following the UK's exit from the EU
The authority to charge customs duty is currently contained in the European Communities Act 1972 (as amended)
which will be repealed by the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill (EUWB). The EUWB will convert the body of existing
EU law into domestic law and preserves the laws made in the UK to implement EU obligations. The powers in the
EUWB to deal with deficiencies arising from withdrawal and to implement the withdrawal agreement cannot be used to
mpose or increase taxation, which includes customs duties. Therefore, the UK will need new primary legislation to
create a standalone customs regime. It will also need to amend the VAT and excise regimes so that they can function
effectively after the UK has left the EU
What are the policy objectives and the intended effects?
The UK will need new primary legislation to create a standalone customs regime, and to amend the VAT and excise
regimes so that they can function as required after the UK has left the EU. This new legislation will include flexibility to
allow the UK to give effect to elements of these regimes through secondary legislation
In assessing options for the UK's future outside of the EU Customs Union, the government will be guided by what
delivers the greatest economic advantage to the UK. It will also be guided by three strategic objectives: ensuring that
UK-EU trade is as frictionless as possible; avoiding a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland; and
establishing an independent international trade policy
The Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill will need to allow the customs, VAT and excise regimes to be amended to
accommodate changes that are necessary or appropriate in consequence of the UK's withdrawal from the EU with or
without an agreement. This includes if the negotiations result in close association with the EU Customs Union for a
time-limited interim period. The Bill does not presuppose any particular outcome from the negotiations with the EU
The government is committed to ensuring that Parliament has due scrutiny of the secondary legislative programme and
that businesses have as much notice as possible of the contents of secondary legislation to prepare for EU exit. The
government will publish further details, including impact assessments where appropriate, when decisions have been
taken on how the regimes will operate in practice

The powers in the EUWB cannot be used to impose or increase taxation. Therefore, the UK will need new primary
legislation to create a standalone customs regime. There will also need to be changes to the VAT and excise regimes

The impact of the new customs regime and amended VAT and excise regimes is dependent on the precise detail of
which changes are brought forward and when (this may mostly be through secondary legislation). However, the Bill
removes the risk that the UK could leave the EU without provision to implement a standalone customs regime and the
powers to ensure the VAT and excise regimes function as required, which would present significant risk.

Background
Approach for assessing impacts
1. The UK's future customs, VAT and excise tax regime will in part be determined by the
outcomes of the negotiations with the European Union (EU). The Taxation (Cross-border
Trade) Bill does not presuppose the outcomes of the negotiations and as is usual practice
for indirect taxes, secondary legislation will be used to set out much of the rules on
administration, collection and enforcement. The government is committed to ensuring that
Parliament has due scrutiny of the secondary legislative programme and that businesses
have as much notice as possible of the contents of secondary legislation to prepare for EU
exit. The government will publish further details, including impact assessments where
appropriate, when decisions have been taken on how the regimes will operate in practice
2. There are connections between the content of the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill and the
Trade bl. The Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill will make provisions relevant to a new UK
tariff, including the power to set customs duty, set quotas and preferences, and set out
additional tariff-related provisions and how they will be administered. This will include, for
example, the tariff applicable to developing countries (unilateral preferences) and in
connection with UK trade remedies and disputes post-EU exit. This will allow the UK to
impose trade remedy measures including anti-dumping duties, anti-subsidy duties and
safeguard measures, where deemed appropriate following an investigation. The Trade Bill
provides key measures that are required to build a future trade policy for the UK once we
leave the EU
3. There are additional border activities undertaken as part of official controls which, while vital
to the UK's trade, safety and security, are not directly related to the collection of customs
duty. These include the regulation of cross-border movements of large sums of cash,
tackling counterfeit goods, detecting firearms, explosives and narcotics, disclosure of
information to other government departments for non-tax purposes and certain non-tax
import and export controls, such as animal, public and plant health checks. The government
will set out proposals in relation to these other areas in due course, working with devolved
administrations as appropriate. These issues are not covered in the Taxation (Cross-border
Trade) Bill and therefore not included in this impact assessment (although this legislation will
contribute to the wider safety and security agenda, for example through providing powers for
continued customs co-operation)
4. The Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill will provide a framework for UK's future Customs
regime which should accommodate most outcomes of the negotiations with the EU as well
as a contingency scenario. It will also ensure that the VAT and excise regimes function as
required. The impacts of the new regime on businesses, consumers and the economy will be
determined by the outcome of the negotiations with the EU and the detailed design of the
new regimes to be set out in secondary legislation as and when appropriate

What is the problem under consideration? Why is government intervention necessary?
In the Future Partnership Paper, the government set out two ambitious approaches which most closely meet its
objectives for the UK's future outside of the EU Customs Union. The Future Partnership Paper also explained that,
regardless of the outcome of these negotiations, the UK will need to legislate for a new customs regime to be in place
by March 2019 that can give effect to whatever arrangements are agreed with its European partners, including an
interim period. The UK will also need to legislate for a new customs regime if there is no negotiated settlement. In
addition, whatever the outcome of the negotiations, the UK will need to make changes to the cross-border rules for the
VAT and excise regimes, following the UK's exit from the EU
The authority to charge customs duty is currently contained in the European Communities Act 1972 (as amended)
which will be repealed by the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill (EUWB). The EUWB will convert the body of existing
EU law into domestic law and preserves the laws made in the UK to implement EU obligations. The powers in the
EUWB to deal with deficiencies arising from withdrawal and to implement the withdrawal agreement cannot be used to
mpose or increase taxation, which includes customs duties. Therefore, the UK will need new primary legislation to
create a standalone customs regime. It will also need to amend the VAT and excise regimes so that they can function
effectively after the UK has left the EU
What are the policy objectives and the intended effects?
The UK will need new primary legislation to create a standalone customs regime, and to amend the VAT and excise
regimes so that they can function as required after the UK has left the EU. This new legislation will include flexibility to
allow the UK to give effect to elements of these regimes through secondary legislation
In assessing options for the UK's future outside of the EU Customs Union, the government will be guided by what

What is the problem under consideration? Why is government intervention necessary?
Currently investigations into unfair trading practices and injurious surges of imports, and the imposition of trade remedy
measures (primarily in the form of duties) to combat them, are handled on the UK's behalf by the European
Commission. When the UK exits the European Union, it will therefore be necessary to put in place a regulatory
framework to allow for unfair trade and surges of imports to be investigated and measures imposed, in accordance with
the relevant World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreements
What are the policy objectives and the intended effects?
To put in place a regulatory framework and investigatory body that will be able to investigate complaints of unfair trade
and surges of imports, and impose proportionate measures (primarily duties) to remedy the injury being caused. This
will enable the protection of UK producers from the harmful effects of dumped, subsidised or surges of imports, and
avoid a cliff edge for UK business on exiting the EU
What policy options have been considered, including any alternatives to regulation? Please justify preferred
option (further details in Evidence Base)
Options are compared against a baseline of continuation of the existing EU framework
Option 0 - Do nothing: Do not have a regulatory framework in place to investigate complaints of injury due to unfair
trade or surges of imports. This is not considered to be a viable option given the potentially damaging consequences to
UK industry

Background
Description of the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill
1. The UK's future customs, VAT and indirect tax regime will in part be determined by the outcomes of
the negotiations with the European Union (EU). The Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill does not
presuppose the outcomes of the negotiations and as is usual practice for indirect taxes, secondary
legislation will be used to set out much of the rules on administration, collection and enforcement
The government is committed to ensuring that Parliament has due scrutiny of the secondary
legislative programme and that businesses have as much notice as possible of the contents of
secondary legislation to prepare for EU exit. The government will publish further details, including
mpact assessments where appropriate, when decisions have been taken on how the regimes will
operate in practice
There are connections between the content of the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill and the Trade
Bill. The Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill will make provisions relevant to a new UK tariff
including the power to set customs duty, set quotas and preferences, and set out additional tariff
related provisions and how they will be administered. This will include, for example, the tariff
applicable to developing countries (unilateral preferences) and in connection with UK trade remedies
and disputes post-EU exit. This will allow the UK to impose trade remedy measures including anti-
dumping duties, anti-subsidy duties and safeguard measures, where deemed appropriate following
an investigation. The Trade Bill provides key measures that are required to build a future trade
policy for the UK once we leave the EU
There are additional border activities undertaken as part of official controls which, while vital to the
UK's trade, safety and security, are not directly related to the collection of customs duty. These
include the regulation of cross-border movements of large sums of cash, tackling counterfeit goods
detecting firearms, explosives and narcotics, disclosure of information to other government
departments for non-tax purposes and certain non-tax import and export controls, such as animal
public and plant health checks. The government will set out proposals in relation to these other
areas in due course, working with devolved administrations as appropriate. These issues are not
covered in the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill and therefore not included in this impact
assessment (although this legislation will contribute to the wider safety and security agenda, for

What is the problem under consideration? Why is government intervention necessary?
Currently investigations into unfair trading practices and injurious surges of imports, and the imposition of trade remedy
measures (primarily in the form of duties) to combat them, are handled on the UK's behalf by the European
Commission. When the UK exits the European Union, it will therefore be necessary to put in place a regulatory
framework to allow for unfair trade and surges of imports to be investigated and measures imposed, in accordance with
the relevant World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreements
What are the policy objectives and the intended effects?
To put in place a regulatory framework and investigatory body that will be able to investigate complaints of unfair trade
and surges of imports, and impose proportionate measures (primarily duties) to remedy the injury being caused. This
will enable the protection of UK producers from the harmful effects of dumped, subsidised or surges of imports, and
avoid a cliff edge for UK business on exiting the EU
What policy options have been considered, including any alternatives to regulation? Please justify preferred
option (further details in Evidence Base)
Options are compared against a baseline of continuation of the existing EU framework
Option 0 - Do nothing: Do not have a regulatory framework in place to investigate complaints of injury due to unfair
trade or surges of imports. This is not considered to be a viable option given the potentially damaging consequences to
UK industry
Option 1 Preferred option: Implement a UK trade remedies framework
Option 2 - Implement a UK trade remedies framework without applying an injury based duty or economic interest test
Will the policy be reviewed? No If applicable, set review date: N/A

The only monetised cost is the cost to the government of setting up and running a body that can investigate complaints
of unfair trade and surges of imports, which is estimated at £15-20m per year. This is not an entirely new cost as the
UK currently makes a contribution to the EU trade remedies regime, but it has not been possible to separate this from
wider budget contributions
Other key non-monetised costs by 'main affected groups'
The main costs will be to users of goods covered by measures (primarily duties), and to interested parties who will
incur costs from involvement in investigations
There are not expected to be any additional costs as compared to a continuation of the current EU trade remedies
framework.

Background
Description of the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill
1. The UK's future customs, VAT and indirect tax regime will in part be determined by the outcomes of
the negotiations with the European Union (EU). The Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill does not
presuppose the outcomes of the negotiations and as is usual practice for indirect taxes, secondary
legislation will be used to set out much of the rules on administration, collection and enforcement
The government is committed to ensuring that Parliament has due scrutiny of the secondary
legislative programme and that businesses have as much notice as possible of the contents of
secondary legislation to prepare for EU exit. The government will publish further details, including
mpact assessments where appropriate, when decisions have been taken on how the regimes will
operate in practice
There are connections between the content of the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill and the Trade
Bill. The Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill will make provisions relevant to a new UK tariff
including the power to set customs duty, set quotas and preferences, and set out additional tariff
related provisions and how they will be administered. This will include, for example, the tariff
applicable to developing countries (unilateral preferences) and in connection with UK trade remedies
and disputes post-EU exit. This will allow the UK to impose trade remedy measures including anti-
dumping duties, anti-subsidy duties and safeguard measures, where deemed appropriate following
an investigation. The Trade Bill provides key measures that are required to build a future trade
policy for the UK once we leave the EU
There are additional border activities undertaken as part of official controls which, while vital to the
UK's trade, safety and security, are not directly related to the collection of customs duty. These
include the regulation of cross-border movements of large sums of cash, tackling counterfeit goods
detecting firearms, explosives and narcotics, disclosure of information to other government
departments for non-tax purposes and certain non-tax import and export controls, such as animal
public and plant health checks. The government will set out proposals in relation to these other
areas in due course, working with devolved administrations as appropriate. These issues are not
covered in the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill and therefore not included in this impact
assessment (although this legislation will contribute to the wider safety and security agenda, for
example through providing powers for continued customs co-operation)
The Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill will provide a framework for UK's future customs, VAT and
excise tax regimes which can accommodate most outcomes of the negotiations with the EU. The
impacts of the new regime on businesses, consumers and the economy will be determined by the
outcome of these negotiations and the detailed design of the new regime to be set out in secondary
legislation as and when appropriate

1. The UK's future customs, VAT and excise tax regime will in part be determined by the

for indirect taxes, secondary legislation will be used to set out much of the rules on

Parliament has due scrutiny of the secondary legislative programme and that businesses

4. The Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill will provide a framework for UK's future Customs
regime which should accommodate most outcomes of the negotiations with the EU as well
as a contingency scenario. It will also ensure that the VAT and excise regimes function as
required. The impacts of the new regime on businesses, consumers and the economy will be
determined by the outcome of the negotiations with the EU and the detailed design of the
new regimes to be set out in secondary legislation as and when appropriate

6. The Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill confers certain powers on the Secretary of State for
International Trade. This is the case for decisions around setting reduced tariffs to
developing countries via unilateral preferences and to set-up and run the UK's future trade
remedies policy which includes the power to impose duties under certain circumstances
where imports cause injury to domestic industry. The Government has confirmed1 that it will
seek to continue offering unilateral preferences to developing countries and will require a
trade remedies regime
7. The impacts of the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill are therefore assessed through three
Impact Assessments
Firstly, an Impact Assessment covering the UK's future customs, VAT and excise
regimes (excluding the unilateral preferences and trade remedies elements)
Secondly this standalone Impact Assessment covering the UK's unilateral preference
regime
.
And finally, a standalone Impact Assessment covering the UK's future trade remedies
regime
The problem under consideration
8. Trade plays a vital role in economic development in developing countries. Open trading
systems allow nations and firms to export more, become more productive and create the
jobs that are needed for inclusive growth. For small and low income countries, the domestic
market for goods and services is small and so ensuring market access for developing
countries to be able to export into the larger markets of developed countries is vital
9. But international trade is still constrained by a wide range of tariff and non-tariff barriers. The
poorest countries also face substantial constraints and barriers to trade relating to
underdeveloped infrastructure, geographical disadvantages or economic vulnerability.
10. Since 1979, it has been recognised in the World Trade Organisation that developed
countries may give developing countries "differential and more favourable treatment", and to
make commitments to remove or reduce tariff or non-tariff barriers for developing countries
without expecting reciprocity. The 'Enabling Clause' is the WTO legal basis for WTO
members to provide zero or reduced tariffs on imports of products originating in developing
countries. Each WTO member can unilaterally determine which countries and which
products are included in their schemes
11. Currently, developing countries receive preferential access to the UK market through the
EU's Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP). As the UK leaves the EU, primary
legislation is needed to allow us to continue to have non-reciprocal reductions in tariffs to
developing countries. The legislation sets out the framework for these reductions. The

example, the tariff applicable to developing countries (unilateral preferences) and in
connection with UK trade remedies and disputes post-EU exit. This will allow the UK to
impose trade remedy measures including anti-dumping duties, anti-subsidy duties and
safeguard measures, where deemed appropriate following an investigation. The Trade Bill
provides key measures that are required to build a future trade policy for the UK once we
leave the EU
3. There are additional border activities undertaken as part of official controls which, while vital
to the UK's trade, safety and security, are not directly related to the collection of customs
duty. These include the regulation of cross-border movements of large sums of cash,
tackling counterfeit goods, detecting firearms, explosives and narcotics, disclosure of
information to other government departments for non-tax purposes and certain non-tax
import and export controls, such as animal, public and plant health checks. The government
will set out proposals in relation to these other areas in due course, working with devolved
administrations as appropriate. These issues are not covered in the Taxation (Cross-border
Trade) Bill and therefore not included in this impact assessment (although this legislation will
contribute to the wider safety and security agenda, for example through providing powers for
continued customs co-operation)
4. The Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill will provide a framework for UK's future Customs
regime which should accommodate most outcomes of the negotiations with the EU as well
as a contingency scenario. It will also ensure that the VAT and excise regimes function as
required. The impacts of the new regime on businesses, consumers and the economy will be
determined by the outcome of the negotiations with the EU and the detailed design of the
new regimes to be set out in secondary legislation as and when appropriate
5. Parliament has voted as part of the debates on the notification of Article 50 to commence the
withdrawal negotiations with the EU, not to disclose material that would put our negotiation
4
position at risk. In assessing the impacts of the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill the
government is therefore taking a proportionate and pragmatic approach, providing more
detail on impacts where the outcome is less dependent on the negotiations with the EU
6. The Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill confers certain powers on the Secretary of State for
International Trade. This is the case for decisions around setting reduced tariffs to
developing countries via unilateral preferences and to set-up and run the UK's future trade
remedies policy which includes the power to impose duties under certain circumstances
where imports cause injury to domestic industry. The Government has confirmed1 that it will
seek to continue offering unilateral preferences to developing countries and will require a
trade remedies regime
7. The impacts of the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill are therefore assessed through three
Impact Assessments
Firstly, an Impact Assessment covering the UK's future customs, VAT and excise
regimes (excluding the unilateral preferences and trade remedies elements)
Secondly this standalone Impact Assessment covering the UK's unilateral preference
regime
.
And finally, a standalone Impact Assessment covering the UK's future trade remedies
regime
The problem under consideration
8. Trade plays a vital role in economic development in developing countries. Open trading
systems allow nations and firms to export more, become more productive and create the
jobs that are needed for inclusive growth. For small and low income countries, the domestic
market for goods and services is small and so ensuring market access for developing
countries to be able to export into the larger markets of developed countries is vital
9. But international trade is still constrained by a wide range of tariff and non-tariff barriers. The
poorest countries also face substantial constraints and barriers to trade relating to
underdeveloped infrastructure, geographical disadvantages or economic vulnerability.
10. Since 1979, it has been recognised in the World Trade Organisation that developed
countries may give developing countries "differential and more favourable treatment", and to
make commitments to remove or reduce tariff or non-tariff barriers for developing countries
without expecting reciprocity. The 'Enabling Clause' is the WTO legal basis for WTO
members to provide zero or reduced tariffs on imports of products originating in developing
countries. Each WTO member can unilaterally determine which countries and which
products are included in their schemes
11. Currently, developing countries receive preferential access to the UK market through the
EU's Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP). As the UK leaves the EU, primary
legislation is needed to allow us to continue to have non-reciprocal reductions in tariffs to
developing countries. The legislation sets out the framework for these reductions. The

Dear Ms White,
I am writing to support the widespread concerned requests for the rejection of
the current bid for full ownership of BskyB by News Corp
At the time of the phone hacking News Corp was identified as a "rogue
corporation" and a "criminal enterprise" and faced the rare possibility of
corporate charges both here and in the US. News Corp paid $224 million in
damages, compensation and fees for lawyers after years of denial, lies and
obstruction, finally forced into retreat by evidence of hacking into the murdered
schoolgirl Millie Dowler's phone. After initially claiming that there were few
victims the Metropolitan police eventually revealed that there may well have
been 4000 victims of hacking.
Rupert Murdoch was labelled "not a fit person to exercise stewardship of a
major international company" (media select committee) and had exhibited a
"serious failure of governance within News of the World, News International
and News Corporation" (Lord Leveson)
James Murdoch's "handling of the hacking had been both difficult to
comprehend and ill-judged and repeatedly fell short of the exercise of
responsibility to be expected of a chief executive and chairman (Ofcom)
This company, News Corp, has not changed - it remains the same to this day.
The same two men, father and son, are orchestrating this current bid.
In the past as owner of the Sun, Rupert Murdoch buys The Times and Sunday
Times in 1981. Margaret Thatcher's government did not refer the bid to the
regulator after a secret lunch between the two at Chequers. Rupert Murdoch
becomes the biggest newspaper proprietor in the UK
In 1986 Robert Maxwell seeks to buy Today and the same government referred
the bid which was blocked. In 1987 when Rupert Murdoch wanted to buy
Today, the government reversed its position.
In 1990 with a communications bill being passed with a new framework for
television Mr Murdoch's new satellite company Sky was exempted. Later that
year when he wanted to merge with BSB the deal was slipped through during a
brief interregnum caused by the death of ITC and the birth of the IBA
But we now face much graver danger. Rupert Murdoch with his association
with Donald Trump, Breitbart, Steve Bannon and the increasingly rabid Fox
News and the worrying death of truth and elevation of alternative interpretations
(lies) should cause fear and alarm. We are aware of the style of management at
Fox with the recent spate of accusations and resignations in a hasty attempt to
clean the act up while the bid here is being considered.
We know that James Murdoch has an irrational hatred of the BBC and our
beloved, popular national broadcaster would be under the severest threat from a
rampant, fully owned Murdoch BskyB. This is a crossroads...if the wrong
turning is taken here it could affect not only broadcasting but our future national
life which could be coarsened and reduced.
I know that you are seeing many people and hearing many voices: Wendy
Walsh, representing women from Fox after serious harassment allegations
(Murdoch: "not worried about sexual harassment") and James Murdoch and you
must be receiving many letters. I hope this one may be taken into account as I
know this view is shared by many worried, anxious people.
Yours sincerely.

Dear Karen
You invited submissions on the issue of a public interest referral of the Sky bid by 21st
Century Fox (21CF) on the grounds of broadcasting standards.
The issue for you is whether to refer the bid to the CMA for more detailed investigation of
whether if Sky becomes 100% owned by 21st Century Fox it would be committed to
compliance with broadcasting standards.
The obvious anxiety about broadcasting standards to which the bid gives rise is that the new
ownership will not be committed to appropriate ethical standards, or appropriate levels of
impartiality, as laid down in the relevant Act and codes under it.
Our case in summary is this: Concerns about the dangers of Sky News being taken in the
direction of Fox News, breaching broadcasting standards, are unanswered by the Ofcom
report
Ofcom finds "significant corporate failure" (fit and proper report, paragraph 10) at Fox
News, on top of what happened at News International. But they then fail in their duty as a
regulator to properly consider this damning evidence in the context of the correct threshold
for a broadcasting standards referral to Ofcom. We believe they have made a serious legal
error in their duties. Indeed we believe this is a sufficiently serious error to be open to
judicial review should you decide not to make a reference on grounds of broadcasting
standards
We believe the standard for you to refer -that the transaction "may operate or may be
expected to operate against the public interest" on grounds of broadcasting standards is
met and we ask you to refer it on those grounds
Constituency Office Telephone Number: 01302 875462
Email: ed.miliband.mp@parliament.uk
In your letter of 3rd March 2017, you expressed three sets of specific concerns about the bid
in the context of broadcasting standards: breaches of the Broadcasting Code by Fox News,
the implications of the phone hacking scandal at the News of the World and evidence of
wider corporate failure at 21CF.
Ofcom's argument in their report is as follows:
1. There are not a significant number of infringements of UK Broadcasting Standards
recorded against either Sky or Fox, so that metric does not suggest a lack of commitment to
Broadcasting Standards
2. They have concluded Sky would remain fit and proper to hold a broadcasting license after
the bid
3 Therefore there is no basis to conclude to that the new ownership of Sky will lead to an
unacceptable lack of commitment to Broadcasting Standards.
Their argument is flawed in the following respects.
Record of Sky and Fox
The report is clear that if the bid proceeds Sky will be controlled by Murdoch family
interests in a way that is materially greater than now. The infringement record of Sky under
its current ownership is therefore little guide to commitment to broadcasting standards in
the future.
In regard to Fox News , Ofcom say "We have not found Fox News to have breached the
accuracy and impartiality provisions of the Broadcasting Code in respect of its news
programming." (public interest report, paragraph 10.26). However, this is likely to be
because the audience is so small (average 2000 across a week) and likely to be in favour of
Fox's point of view, and therefore unlikely to complain. Moreover, Ofcom themselves
acknowledge that they are not subject to the impartiality rules of major UK outlets.
You asked for a qualitative assessment of breaches by Fox News. This is not explicitly
addressed in the report, although Ofcom say there were no sanctions for the breaches that
took place. However, those breaches that have been found indicate the dangers of the
opinionated approach to content-for example the widely publicized view on Fox News that
areas of Britain were "no-go areas" for "non-Muslims"
Moreover, what Ofcom's report exposes is that there was no compliance procedure within
Fox until mid May of this year. This leads Ofcom to say there are "significant concerns about
Fox's approach to ensuring Fox News content compliance with the Broadcasting Code"
(public interest report 2.51)
The new compliance procedure was only introduced as a result of Fox's attempts to
persuade the regulators to allow the bid to proceed. This is a clear breach of basic standards
and totally at odds with Fox's previous claim that since 2011 their corporate governance
procedures had been"fixed". This failure to comply with basic requirements undermines any
confidence about the commitment to broadcasting standards, and indeed the new system
has not even been tested in practice.
We also know Rupert Murdoch has expressed a wish to make Sky News more like Fox News.
As Ofcom acknowledge in relation to plurality "We are concerned that following the
transaction, members of the Murdoch Family Trust may be able to influence the output of
Sky News to align its editorial stance with that of Fox News and the News Corp
titles...". (public interest report 9.7)
Ofcom goes on to recognise the danger that the broadcasting code is an insufficient
protection against the Murdoch family ensuring all its media outlets adopt a similar editorial
outlook. They say: "[The Broadcasting Code] does not provide for [Ofcom] to take a view on
the overarching approach of a channel, for example, the specific news stories that it covers
or its tone." (public interest report, 9.11)
But if Ofcom believes there is a danger that Mr Murdoch might use greater control over Sky
to pursue a political agenda which does not respect impartiality but stays within the code
there must also be an equally legitimate worry that he might do so in ways that contravene
the code, for example in the way stories are covered. That is the significance of the way Fox
News already operates in other jurisdictions.
In considering what may happen if Sky becomes 100% owned by 21CF this possibility is not
even discussed by Ofcom. They simply assert that Mr Murdoch has said that if he took Sky
down a road more like Fox News, it would need to be within the code. But we contend that
Mr Murdoch's assertions are simply an inadequate basis on which to conclude there is no
issue for the CMA to investigate, particularly given his long and indeed recent history of
regulatory non-compliance, two examples of which we discuss below
In summary, we do not believe the risks that Sky News become more like Fox, thereby
threatening broadcasting standards is adequately considered or answered by Ofcom
News International
You asked in your letter of March 3rd 2017 for Ofcom to consider the "extent to which 21CF
and the individuals who will have control of Sky and/or who will be responsible for carrying
on the business of Sky following the merger have a good record of compliance more
generally..." and you go on to cite the experience at the News of the World.
In their report on broadcasting standards to you, Ofcom say they have considered: "the
recent track record of regulatory compliance by newspaper titles operated in the UK by
News Corp, and the extent to which this may provide an indication of whether Fox has a
genuine commitment to the attainment of the broadcasting standards objectives" (public
interest report, 10.30)
3
Unfortunately, Ofcom focus only on breaches of the code of IPSO. IPSO is a regulator that
does not meet the criteria agreed by Parliament in relation to independence and
effectiveness and has therefore been refused recognition by the panel established by the
government under the Royal Charter. It is inexplicable that Ofcom should place any reliance
on the record of News UK compliance with IPSO's code.
But of even more concern is that OfCom does not in any way address the record of the
News of the World and News International more broadly in their report on broadcasting
standards. The convictions of senior employees and executives, the corrupt payments to
police and public officials who were convicted for taking them, the finding that two senior
executives lied to Parliament, the attempt to pervert the course of justice by senior
journalist Mazher Mahmood all speak precisely to regulatory compliance. It is a deeply
regrettable omission by Ofcom to not even address this specifically in its analysis of
regulatory compliance for the purposes of broadcasting standards particularly given that
you asked them to do so
In your letter to Ofcom, you also explicitly asked them to look at the implications of the
behavior of James Murdoch. You were clear that "James Murdoch as CEO of 21CF would
have responsibilities relating to Sky News following the merger as well as an increased level
of control or influence over Sky"
As you put it "His failures were essentially failures of corporate governance" and you asked
for a "report on the implications, if any of these matters for the commitment to
broadcasting standards ground
Ofcom do not do this. Ofcom say there is no "new material evidence directly touching on
these individuals" (fit and proper, paragraph 70). We dispute this, but in any case, this is not
the question you asked. Instead you asked for the implications of what Ofcom had already
discovered about Mr Murdoch for his future role as CEO of Sky.
Ofcom said in their 2012 fitness and propriety report "We consider that the events set out
above raise questions regarding James Murdoch's competence in the handling of these
matters, and his attitude towards the possibility of wrongdoing in the companies for which
he was responsible" (fit and proper, 2012 report, paragraph 36)
It went on to say that in the circumstances of the time, they were not considering Mr
Murdoch in the role of chief executive or chairman: "Whilst we consider that James
Murdoch's conduct in various instances fell short of the standard to be expected of the chief
executive officer and chairman, we do not find that James Murdoch's retention as a non
executive director of Sky means that Sky is not fit and proper to hold broadcast licences
(emphasis added) (fit and proper 2012, paragraph 46)
So the question of Mr Murdoch's role as CEO, which you specifically asked to be considered,
remains unaddressed. Indeed, far from looking at the implications of the past conduct of Mr
Murdoch, Ofcom say that a new corporate governance code can be trusted because "James
Murdoch and Lachlan Murdoch have put themselves personally behind [it]" (fit and proper,
2017, paragraph 71)
We believe that Ofcom has not, as you asked, addressed the corporate failures at News
International and their implications for broadcasting standards, nor the role of Mr James
Murdoch. On these grounds alone, a broadcasting standards referral is now clearly
necessary to address these matters going forward
Conduct at Fox News
You also asked Ofcom whether the corporate failures at News Corporation, now 21CF, have
been satisfactorily remedied. We now know that Fox News has over decades had very
senior employees who have infringed required standards in relation to sexual harassment
and Fox News did nothing about it until recently and then only when publicity focused on
the issue.
As a result, Ofcom finds "significant corporate failure" at Fox News, around the handling of
sexual harassment and other issues. They are right. Despite this, they conclude that Sky
would remain fit and proper to hold a broadcast license in the event of 100% Murdoch
control. While we dispute this conclusion, we recognise that is not the point at issue for you.
You must adjudicate on a separate question: whether the "significant corporate failure" at
Fox News raises concerns about Sky's commitment to broadcasting Standards (once it is
100% owned by 21st Century Fox) and whether you should make a referral to the CMA.
Different thresholds
Whilst many of the factua! issues may overlap there is a pivotal difference in the thresholds
of evidence that need to be applied for an assessment, on the one hand, of fitness and
propriety and on the other, a broadcasting standards referral to the CMA. Indeed, in
Ofcom's own words one is a "high" threshold and the other "low".
According to Ofcom: "If a broadcaster is found to be not fit and proper to hold a
particular licence, then by law Ofcom must revoke that licence...This is a major
interference with freedom of speech... Ofcom considers that the threshold for finding
a broadcaster not fit and proper to hold a broadcast licence is, therefore, high." (Fit
and proper, paragraph 18)
By contrast, they say about a referral to the CMA on grounds of broadcasting standards
"The threshold for a reference is low. The Secretary of State would need to hold a
reasonable belief that it may be the case that the transaction may operate or may be
expected to operate against the public interest." (public interest report, paragraph 1.2)

there must also be an equally legitimate worry that he might do so in ways that contravene
the code, for example in the way stories are covered. That is the significance of the way Fox
News already operates in other jurisdictions.
In considering what may happen if Sky becomes 100% owned by 21CF this possibility is not
even discussed by Ofcom. They simply assert that Mr Murdoch has said that if he took Sky
down a road more like Fox News, it would need to be within the code. But we contend that
Mr Murdoch's assertions are simply an inadequate basis on which to conclude there is no
issue for the CMA to investigate, particularly given his long and indeed recent history of
regulatory non-compliance, two examples of which we discuss below
In summary, we do not believe the risks that Sky News become more like Fox, thereby
threatening broadcasting standards is adequately considered or answered by Ofcom
News International
You asked in your letter of March 3rd 2017 for Ofcom to consider the "extent to which 21CF
and the individuals who will have control of Sky and/or who will be responsible for carrying
on the business of Sky following the merger have a good record of compliance more
generally..." and you go on to cite the experience at the News of the World.
In their report on broadcasting standards to you, Ofcom say they have considered: "the
recent track record of regulatory compliance by newspaper titles operated in the UK by
News Corp, and the extent to which this may provide an indication of whether Fox has a
genuine commitment to the attainment of the broadcasting standards objectives" (public
interest report, 10.30)
3
Unfortunately, Ofcom focus only on breaches of the code of IPSO. IPSO is a regulator that
does not meet the criteria agreed by Parliament in relation to independence and
effectiveness and has therefore been refused recognition by the panel established by the
government under the Royal Charter. It is inexplicable that Ofcom should place any reliance
on the record of News UK compliance with IPSO's code.
But of even more concern is that OfCom does not in any way address the record of the
News of the World and News International more broadly in their report on broadcasting
standards. The convictions of senior employees and executives, the corrupt payments to
police and public officials who were convicted for taking them, the finding that two senior
executives lied to Parliament, the attempt to pervert the course of justice by senior
journalist Mazher Mahmood all speak precisely to regulatory compliance. It is a deeply
regrettable omission by Ofcom to not even address this specifically in its analysis of
regulatory compliance for the purposes of broadcasting standards particularly given that
you asked them to do so
In your letter to Ofcom, you also explicitly asked them to look at the implications of the
behavior of James Murdoch. You were clear that "James Murdoch as CEO of 21CF would
have responsibilities relating to Sky News following the merger as well as an increased level
of control or influence over Sky"
As you put it "His failures were essentially failures of corporate governance" and you asked
for a "report on the implications, if any of these matters for the commitment to
broadcasting standards ground
Ofcom do not do this. Ofcom say there is no "new material evidence directly touching on
these individuals" (fit and proper, paragraph 70). We dispute this, but in any case, this is not
the question you asked. Instead you asked for the implications of what Ofcom had already
discovered about Mr Murdoch for his future role as CEO of Sky.
Ofcom said in their 2012 fitness and propriety report "We consider that the events set out
above raise questions regarding James Murdoch's competence in the handling of these
matters, and his attitude towards the possibility of wrongdoing in the companies for which
he was responsible" (fit and proper, 2012 report, paragraph 36)
It went on to say that in the circumstances of the time, they were not considering Mr
Murdoch in the role of chief executive or chairman: "Whilst we consider that James
Murdoch's conduct in various instances fell short of the standard to be expected of the chief
executive officer and chairman, we do not find that James Murdoch's retention as a non
executive director of Sky means that Sky is not fit and proper to hold broadcast licences
(emphasis added) (fit and proper 2012, paragraph 46)
So the question of Mr Murdoch's role as CEO, which you specifically asked to be considered,
remains unaddressed. Indeed, far from looking at the implications of the past conduct of Mr
Murdoch, Ofcom say that a new corporate governance code can be trusted because "James
Murdoch and Lachlan Murdoch have put themselves personally behind [it]" (fit and proper,
2017, paragraph 71)
We believe that Ofcom has not, as you asked, addressed the corporate failures at News
International and their implications for broadcasting standards, nor the role of Mr James
Murdoch. On these grounds alone, a broadcasting standards referral is now clearly
necessary to address these matters going forward
Conduct at Fox News
You also asked Ofcom whether the corporate failures at News Corporation, now 21CF, have
been satisfactorily remedied. We now know that Fox News has over decades had very
senior employees who have infringed required standards in relation to sexual harassment
and Fox News did nothing about it until recently and then only when publicity focused on
the issue.
As a result, Ofcom finds "significant corporate failure" at Fox News, around the handling of
sexual harassment and other issues. They are right. Despite this, they conclude that Sky
would remain fit and proper to hold a broadcast license in the event of 100% Murdoch
control. While we dispute this conclusion, we recognise that is not the point at issue for you.
You must adjudicate on a separate question: whether the "significant corporate failure" at
Fox News raises concerns about Sky's commitment to broadcasting Standards (once it is
100% owned by 21st Century Fox) and whether you should make a referral to the CMA.
Different thresholds
Whilst many of the factua! issues may overlap there is a pivotal difference in the thresholds
of evidence that need to be applied for an assessment, on the one hand, of fitness and
propriety and on the other, a broadcasting standards referral to the CMA. Indeed, in
Ofcom's own words one is a "high" threshold and the other "low".
According to Ofcom: "If a broadcaster is found to be not fit and proper to hold a
particular licence, then by law Ofcom must revoke that licence...This is a major
interference with freedom of speech... Ofcom considers that the threshold for finding
a broadcaster not fit and proper to hold a broadcast licence is, therefore, high." (Fit
and proper, paragraph 18)
By contrast, they say about a referral to the CMA on grounds of broadcasting standards
"The threshold for a reference is low. The Secretary of State would need to hold a
reasonable belief that it may be the case that the transaction may operate or may be
expected to operate against the public interest." (public interest report, paragraph 1.2)

Dear Secretary of State,
Re: 21st Century Fox's bid for Sky
As you know, we are instructed by Avaaz, the global citizens' movement. We write further to our letter
of 10 July, which concerned the possibility of accepting undertakings in lieu of reference to the CMA on
media plurality grounds. The present letter deals with your statement that you were minded not to refer
the transaction to the CMA on broadcasting standards grounds.
In essence, the section of OFCOM's report to you that deals with broadcasting standards grounds is so
flawed that it is not reasonably open to you to decline, on the basis of that section, to make a reference
on broadcasting standards grounds.
The correct threshold
We start by observing that under the statutory test - article 5(2) (c)1 of the Enterprise Act (Protection of
Legitimate Interests) Order 2003 ("the Order")- you have power to make a reference if you believe that
it is or may be the case that, taking account only of the broadcasting standards consideration, the creation
of the merger situation may be expected to operate against the public interest.
However, despite a brief reference to the correct test at $1.2 of their report, it is in fact apparent that
OFCOM have applied a different, and higher standard. Thus, at $10.51 (which concludes a very short
section on this point), they state that "we do not consider that this evidence [the Culture Select
Committee's findings of huge failures of corporate governance at News Corporation and the 'extremely

OFCOM have applied a different, and higher standard. Thus, at §10.51 (which concludes a very short
section on this point), they state that "we do not consider that this evidence [the Culture Select
Committee's findings of huge failures of corporate governance at News Corporation and the 'extremeljy
disturbing and serious allegations of sexual and racial harassment at Fox News] demonstrates that the
merged entity would lack a genuine commitment to the attainment of broadcasting standards" (emphasis
added)
But that is a basic misdirection in law: the question for you is not whether it has been demonstrated that
the merged entity would lack such a commitment, but, rather, whether it “may be the case" that it would
do so. While it would not be right to make a reference if the concern was purely fanciful, you do have
power to do so even if the likelihood that such concerns will be substantiated is less than 50%: see IBA
Health v OFT [2004] EWCA Civ 142 at S$47-48.
Moreover, it is irrelevant to your consideration that OFCOM have, separately, concluded that that
evidence is insufficient for it at this stage to take the step of withdrawing Sky's licence under the
Broadcasting Acts. OFCOM make it clear in their "fit and proper" decision that they were not applying the
"may be the case" test that you are required to apply: rather, they state at $54 and 18 of that decision
that they were applying a "high" threshold. Indeed, as is apparent from §4 of that decision, OFCOM's
reasoning in support of a "high" threshold in relation to its "fit and proper" decision relies on the point
that immediate cessation of a licence is a major disruption to the status quo with substantial
consequences for shareholders, employees, and viewers. That consideration does not apply to a decision
to refer a proposed merger to the CMA, which cannot result in any removal of rights or benefits currently
enjoyed by shareholders, employees or viewers. Further, such a decision does no more than result in a
detailed fact-finding exercise enabling the CMA to get to the bottom of the concerns and to report to you
accordingly so that you can decide, on the basis of full information, whether the status quo should be
maintained or whether the transaction should be allowed to proceed.
Finally, it is important to bear in mind that the CMA has powers, in a merger reference, to obtair
documents and information, and to obtain by compulsion written and oral evidence, under criminal
sanction for supplying false or misleading information: see, for example, sections 109 and 117 of the
Enterprise Act 2002, as applied by Schedule 3 to the Order. Those powers are not available to OFCOM

Sky's compliance record since 2012 is irrelevant: the question is how it is likely to behave when
wholly controlled by the Murdoch family through Fox.
Fox's compliance record in the UK (or EU) throws little light on anything. Fox News is at present
a marginal broadcaster in the UK (and EU) with a tiny audience (2,000 or so in the UK). It is likely
(or at least entirely possible) that its tiny audience chooses Fox News precisely because of its bias
and disregard for factual accuracy (vividly demonstrated by its promulgation of the canard relating
to alleged "no go" areas for non-Muslims in Birmingham2): so they are unlikely to complain about
inaccuracy or lack of due impartiality. In any event, OFCOM accept that they do not apply to Fox
News the impartiality rules that they apply to major broadcasters such as Sky.
e
o
e On the other hand, Fox's failure to put in place adequate procedures to ensure Fox News'
compliance with UK broadcasting standards is clear evidence of a failure to take those standards
seriously. A hurried instatement of compliance procedures, only when pointed out and only in
the context of an ongoing regulatory investigation, is of very limited comfort in that regard
e Further, Fox News' bias and contempt for accuracy amply demonstrated in the evidence put to
OFCOM and to you is a matter for serious concern. It is no answer to that concern to observe
that US regulatory standards do not require impartiality: the point is that Fox News shows the
type of news product that the Murdoch family and companies under their control wish to produce
when permitted to do so, namely biased and inaccurate news, designed to suit their political
agenda and business interests. The question that you are then obliged to ask -but which OFCOM
fail to ask - is whether, in the UK regulatory context, there are non-fanciful concerns that a
broadcaster under the control of a family with such a record of producing biased and inaccurate
news where they can will fail to comply with broadcasting standards relating to impartiality and
accuracy. The only possible answer to that question is "yes": such concerns are not fanciful. We
note in particular that: -
o Paying lip service to compliance with the Broadcasting Code (see $10.46) is of little
comfort if there are real concerns (for the reasons referred to at SS10.46-48) that the
Murdoch family regard that Code's provisions on impartiality as an unwarranted
imposition and that (as Fox News shows) they will produce biased news where they can.
Further, there are real and non-fanciful concerns, based on their history of regulatory
non-compliance, that the Murdoch family do not in fact take their regulatory obligations

support the Murdoch's agenda rather than those who do not support it the dangers
expressly recognised by OFCoM at 9.7. Such insidious bias is unlikely to generate
complaints and is inherently difficult to prove: it is therefore unlikely to lead to
enforcement action.
News International
Avaaz agrees with the letter sent today by the Rt Hon Ed Miliband MP and others, a copy of which we
have seen. It is not enough to consider the conduct of News International only in relation to the IPSO
Editors' Code, for the reasons given in that letter. Moreover, as explained in that letter, OFCOM fail
adequately or at all to examine whether there are non-fanciful concerns arising from the role of James
Murdoch as CEO, given OFCOM's own findings in 2012 about his conduct in relation to the newspapers
owned by News International and the hacking scandal. Any proper examination of that matter would
have concluded that there were non-fanciful concerns in relation to broadcasting standards arising from
3 In this and the previous example given here, OFCOM's position appears to be that there is inadequate evidence
to link the Murdoch family to those matters: we deal with that issue in the following sections of this letter.

James Murdoch's role in the hacking scandal, and that those concerns should be addressed by the CMA
in detail and with the aid of the extensive powers to obtain evidence at the CMA's disposal
Conduct of Fox News
Again, Avaaz agrees with the Miliband letter. The key point is that OFCOM concluded that the nature and
extent of the allegations made were "extremely serious and disturbing": §10.50. But (because, as
explained above, OFCOM misdirected themselves as to the threshold) OFCOM failed to draw the
inevitable conclusion that those allegations gave rise to non-fanciful concerns as to corporate governance
and compliance with the law at Fox News. Further, OFCOM failed, applying the correct threshold, to
consider whether there were non-fanciful concerns that the Murdoch family, as controllers of Fox News,
were responsible for those failings. As to that, its findings in its "fit and proper" decision on the
responsibility of the Murdoch family for failings at Fox News are irrelevant for present purposes because:
(a) those findings there were on the basis of a different, "high", threshold and not the "non-fanciful
concern" threshold at issue here; and (b) those findings were made without deploying the extensive
powers to verify the claims made by the Murdoch family as to their non-involvement that are available to
the CMA.
Conclusion
In the light of the matters set out above, we consider that you would not be acting lawfully if you declined,
on the basis of the OFCOM report, to make a reference to the CMA on broadcasting standards grounds.
If you do decide not to make such a reference, our clients would urgently consider a legal challenge to
that decision.
Yours faithfully.

owned by News International and the hacking scandal. Any proper examination of that matter would
have concluded that there were non-fanciful concerns in relation to broadcasting standards arising from
3 In this and the previous example given here, OFCOM's position appears to be that there is inadequate evidence
to link the Murdoch family to those matters: we deal with that issue in the following sections of this letter.

James Murdoch's role in the hacking scandal, and that those concerns should be addressed by the CMA
in detail and with the aid of the extensive powers to obtain evidence at the CMA's disposal
Conduct of Fox News
Again, Avaaz agrees with the Miliband letter. The key point is that OFCOM concluded that the nature and
extent of the allegations made were "extremely serious and disturbing": §10.50. But (because, as
explained above, OFCOM misdirected themselves as to the threshold) OFCOM failed to draw the
inevitable conclusion that those allegations gave rise to non-fanciful concerns as to corporate governance
and compliance with the law at Fox News. Further, OFCOM failed, applying the correct threshold, to
consider whether there were non-fanciful concerns that the Murdoch family, as controllers of Fox News,
were responsible for those failings. As to that, its findings in its "fit and proper" decision on the
responsibility of the Murdoch family for failings at Fox News are irrelevant for present purposes because:
(a) those findings there were on the basis of a different, "high", threshold and not the "non-fanciful
concern" threshold at issue here; and (b) those findings were made without deploying the extensive
powers to verify the claims made by the Murdoch family as to their non-involvement that are available to
the CMA.
Conclusion
In the light of the matters set out above, we consider that you would not be acting lawfully if you declined,
on the basis of the OFCOM report, to make a reference to the CMA on broadcasting standards grounds.
If you do decide not to make such a reference, our clients would urgently consider a legal challenge to
that decision.
Yours faithfully.

Dear Secretary of State,
Re: 21st Century Fox's bid for Sky
We write on behalf of our client the global citizens charity Avaaz, with regard to your pre recess oral update
to Parliament on the 20th June. We were heartened by your confirmation to the House, that you are "still
minded-to refer on the media plurality ground and still minded-not-to accept the undertakings in lieu of a
reference".
We are very concerned however, that you may have felt pressured by the letter of July 17 from 21st Century
Fox urging you to make your final decision in the coming days'. We note that you expressly stated, that you
may make your final decision on referral-including in respect of the broadcasting standard ground
"potentially during the summer recess".
It is clear from the evidence submitted to you that the extraordinary disregard the Murdochs have had for
both their own commitments to regulators and for politicians internationally, warranted the extension of
time given to gather evidence. In these circumstances, a final decision not to refer on either grounds that is
not followed by an immediate full and open Parliamentary process, would we suggest, send a strong signal
that the public interest was being blithely set side, in favour of an easier passage through for Fox News.
Their letter of July 17th attempting to push you into making a decision during the recess is exactly

the kind of tactic to be expected in order to avoid further scrutiny and opposition to their bid, and would

What is the problem under consideration? Why is government intervention necessary?
For many, across generations, full participation in society and the economy is impossible without access to the internet
10Mbps is the minimum download speed that Ofcom says is needed to meet the typical needs of an average family.
However, there are still some areas of the UK, particularly, although not exclusively, the more rural areas, which cannot
eceive speeds of at least 10Mbps as the necessary infrastructure has not been deployed there. There are limits to what
he market can deliver through competition alone, and limited commercial incentives for any firm to roll out broadband
infrastructure to these areas, given the large investment necessary, and the relatively low returns. Ofcom's Connected
Nations 2017 report shows that the number of premises without 10Mbps broadband download and 1Mbps upload speeds
is 1.1 million, or 4% of premises, compared with 1.6 million or 6% of premises in 2016, Government intervention is
necessary on an equity basis to ensure households and small businesses in these areas do not get left behind
What are the policy objectives and the intended effects?
Policy objectives are designed to reduce the negative social and economic impacts of the digital divide by ensuring
universal affordable access to decent broadband. This will help ensure people can fully engage in the digital society
and provide productivity benefits to businesses which use broadband. The preferred option would provide access to
download speeds of 10Mbps (with other specified quality requirements) by 2020
What policy options have been considered, including any alternatives to regulation? Please justify preferred
option (further details in Evidence Base)
Regulatory options considered were
1)
10Mbps connection with no further quality requirements
2)
10Mbps download and 1Mbps upload with other quality requirements. (Preferred)
3) 20Mbps download and 2Mbps upload with quality requirements
4)
30Mbps download and 6Mbps upload with quality requirements
he Government also considered two non-regulatory options: state funding and a non-regulatory proposal from BT, but
ecided not to pursue these in favour of a regulatory broadband Universal Service Obligation (USO)
he purpose of the regulation is to provide a safety-net in a proportionate manner, in line with the requirements of the EU
egulatory framework. This is an intervention targeted at areas of market failure, where the market has not delivered and i
not expected to deliver improved connectivity, as the costs of doing so are high, and the returns they can expect to
receive, particularly in sparsely populated rural areas, are low. It is intended to ensure that end users do not experience
ignificant social and economic disadvantage compared to end users with access to broadband in competitive markets
nd that they can participate fully in digital society
he challenge is to give people a good minimum level of connectivity at affordable prices to allow access to services, suc
s web browsing, email and certain video services, which meet the needs of a typical family and many small firm:s
However, setting a minimum level of connectivity has the potential to distort the broadband market, reduce competition
nd reduce or divert investment in infrastructure projects, particularly in under-served or rural areas. A further
onsideration is the impact that this intervention will potentially have on consumer prices, given that it is to be delivered
sing industry funding, and we can assume that some or all of these costs will be passed on in higher prices. It needs to
meet the policy objective while at the same time ensuring that any negative effects on the market are minimised
Option 1-while lower cost, this option does not give people the connectivity they need for common applications,
such as video conferencing and sharing large images and video files, which require a specified upload speed, and
which are available to the majority
Options 3 and 4, give an improved level of connectivity, but come with much higher costs. Higher costs will
impose a greater burden on those in industry who will be required to contribute to an industry cost sharing fund this
will be determined by Ofcom in due course, and while Ofcom will be expected to do so in a way that minimises market
distortion, some market distortion will arise, and it would be reasonable to assume this distortion would increase with
higher costs. These options would also take longer to deliver, which is particularly pertinent given how long
households and businesses in USO areas have waited to see connectivity improvement. They would also not be
proportionate because these specifications at this time do more than simply provide for functional internet access
hile the BCR is higher for options 3 and 4, the BCR is not the only consideration to be taken into account in designing
noted above, of possible increased market distortion, which may result in reduced competition, reduced market investmen
his policy intervention. This needs to be balanced against the time to deliver the service, and the negative impacts, as
nd increased consumer prices
fcom has advised that a 10Mbps specification (with quality parameters) is sufficient to meet the needs of a typical
household. And while it will be necessary to keep the minimum specification under review, it is not appropriate to set i
igher now, even if this does create the potential for efficiency savings in the long term, as this will go beyond Article 4 of
he Universal Service Directive which requires that "the connection provided shall be capable of supporting voice, facsimil
nd data communications at data rates that are sufficient to permit functional Internet access, taking into account
prevailing technologies used by the majority of subscribers and technological feasibility
herefore, Option 2, which generates a NPV of £2.49bn and a BCR of 3.4 is the preferred option. While Option 2 does nc
enerate the best NPV and BCR, it generates significant benefits, and we believe it strikes a balance between meeting
onsumer needs for an improved minimum level of connectivity, and minimising market distortion more so than any of the
ther options. It achieves a balance between ensuring that as many consumers as possible benefit from a good level of
onnectivity under the USO while at the same time ensuring that the costs of delivery are not disproportionate, and
negative impacts on the market are minimised

LONDON SW1A 2AA
THE PRIME MINISTER
14 April 2018
Dear Colleague
Last night British, French and American armed forces conducted co-ordinated
and targeted strikes to degrade the Syrian Regime's chemical weapons capability
and deter their use.
For the UK's part, four RAF Tornado GR 4s launched Storm Shadow missiles at
a military facility some 15 miles west of Homs, where the regime is assessed to
keep chemical weapons in breach of Syria's obligations under the Chemical
Weapons Convention
While the full assessment of the strike is ongoing, we are confident of its success.
These strikes follow the news from last Saturday that up to 75 people, including
young children, were killed in a despicable and barbaric attack in Douma, with
as many as 500 further casualties.
We have worked with our allies to establish what happened. All the indications
are that this was a chemical weapons attack
We have seen the harrowing images of men, women and children lying dead with
foam in their mouths. These were innocent families who, at the time this chemical
weapon was unleashed, were seeking shelter underground, in basements.
First-hand accounts from NGOs and aid workers have detailed the most horrific
suffering, including burns to the eyes, suffocation and skin discolouration, with a
chlorine-like odour surrounding the victims. And the World Health Organisation
has received reports that hundreds of patients arrived at Syrian heath facilities on
Saturday night with "signs and symptoms consistent with exposure to toxic
chemicals."
2
We are clear about who was responsible for this atrocity. A significant body of
information including intelligence indicates the Syrian Regime is responsible for
this latest attack.
While there is some information which I am unable to disclose, I can set out some
of the evidence that leads us to this conclusion
Open source accounts allege that a barrel bomb was used to deliver the chemicals.
Multiple open source reports claim that a Regime helicopter was observed above
the city of Douma on the evening of 7h April
The Opposition does not operate helicopters or use barrel bombs. And reliable
intelligence indicates that Syrian military officials co-ordinated what appears to
be the use of chlorine in Douma on 7th April.
No other group could have carried out this attack. Indeed, Daesh for example does
not even have a presence in Douma
And the fact of this attack should surprise no-one. We know that the Syrian
regime has an utterly abhorrent record of using chemical weapons against its own
people.
On 21St August 2013 over 800 people were killed and thousands more injured in
a chemical attack also in Ghouta. There were 14 further smaller scale chemical
attacks prior to that Summer
At Khan Shaykhun on 4th April last year, the Syrian Regime used sarin against its
people killing around 100 with a further 500 casualties.
Based on the Regime's persistent pattern ofbehaviour and the cumulative analysis
of specific incidents we judge it highly likely both that the Syrian regime has
continued to use chemical weapons since then, and will continue to do so
This must be stopped. We have sought to do so using every possible diplomatic
channel but our efforts have been repeatedly thwarted both on the ground and in
the UN
Following the sarin attack in Eastern Damascus back in August 2013, the Syrian
Regime committed to dismantle its chemical weapon programme - and Russia
promised to ensure that Syria did this, overseen by the Organisation for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons
3
These commitments have not been met. A recent report from the Organisation for
the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has said that Syria's declaration of its
former Chemical Weapons programme is incomplete. This indicates that it
continues to retain undeclared stocks of nerve agent or precursor chemicals - and
is likely to be continuing with some chemical weapons production
The OPCW inspectors have investigated previous attacks and on four occasions
decided that the Regime was indeed responsible.
And on each occasion when we have seen every sign of chemical weapons being
used, any attempt to hold the perpetrators to account has been blocked by Russia
at the UN Security Council, with six such vetoes since the start of 2017. Just this
week, the Russians vetoed a draft Resolution that would have established an
independent investigation into this latest attack - even making the grotesque and
absurd claim that it was "staged" by Britain
So we have no choice but to conclude that diplomatic action on its own will not
be any more effective in the future than it has been in the past.
Over the last week the UK government has been working intensively with our
international partners to build the evidence picture, and to consider what action
we need to take to prevent and deter future humanitarian catastrophes caused by
chemical weapons attacks
When the Cabinet met on Thursday we considered the advice of the Attorney
General, the National Security Adviser and the Chief of Defence Staff - and we
were updated on the latest assessment and intelligence picture.
And based on this advice we agreed that it was both right and legal to take military
action, together with our closest allies, to alleviate further humanitarian suffering
by degrading the Syrian Regime's Chemical Weapons capability and deterring
their use
This was not about intervening in a civil war. And it was not about regime change.
As I discussed with President Trump and President Macron, it was a limited
targeted and effective strike with clear boundaries that expressly sought to avoid
escalation and did everything possible to prevent civilian casualties.
4
Together we have hit a specific and limited set of targets. They were a chemical
weapons storage and production facility, a key chemical weapons research centre
and a military bunker involved in chemical weapons attacks,
Hitting these targets with the force that we have deployed will significantly
degrade the Syrian Regime's ability to research, develop and deploy chemical
weapons
A year ago, after the atrocity at Khan Shaykhun, the US conducted a strike on the
airfield from which the attack took place. But Assad and his regime hasn't
stopped their use of chemical weapons.
So last night's strikes by the US, UK and France were significantly larger than
the US action a year ago and specifically designed to have a greater impact on the
regime's capability and willingness to use chemical weapons.
And this collective action sends a clear message that the international community
will not stand by and tolerate the use of chemical weapons
I also want to be clear that this military action to deter the use of chemical
weapons does not stand alone. We must remain committed to resolving the
conflict at large. The best hope for the Syrian people remains a political solution.
We need all partners - especially the Regime and its backers - to enable
humanitarian access to those in desperate need. And the UK will continue to strive
for both.,
But these strikes are about deterring the barbaric use of chemical weapons in
Syria and bevond.
And so to achieve this there must also be a wider diplomatic effort - including
the full range of political and economic levers - to strengthen the global norms
prohibiting the use of chemical weapons which have stood for nearly a century
Although of a much lower order of magnitude, the use of a nerve agent on the
streets of the UK in recent weeks is part of a pattern of disregard for these norms.
So while this action is specifically about deterring the Syrian regime, it will also
send a clear signal to anyone else who believes they can use chemical weapons
with impunity.
here is no graver decision for a Prime Minister than to commit our forces to
combat - and this is the first time that I have had to do so,
5
As always, they have served our country with the greatest professionalism and
bravery - and we owe them a huge debt of gratitude.
We would have preferred an alternative path. But on this occasion there is none.
We cannot allow the use of chemical weapons to become normalised - either
within Syria, on the streets of the UK or elsewhere
We must reinstate the global consensus that chemical weapons cannot be used
This action is absolutely in Britain's national interest.
The lesson of history is that when the global rules and standards that keep us safe
come under threat we must take a stand and defend them
That is what our country has always done. And that is what we will continue to

Yours Sincerely

Dear
Thank you for your email of 30 January 2018 requesting the following information:
"1: How many regular armed forces personnel have been medically discharged with epilepsy as the
primary condition, that has been recorded from 2010.
2:How many armed forces personnel are still serving with epilepsy since 2010.
3:How many armed forces personnel received compensation ( under the armed forces compensation
scheme) for a primary condition of epilepsy since 2010
4:How many armed forces personnel have got epilepsy though a trauma while serving in the armed
forces since 2010"
I am treating your correspondence as a request for information under the Freedom of Information Act
2000
A search for the information has now been completed within the Ministry of Defence, and I can confirm
that information in scope of your request is held
Between 1 April 2010 and 31 March 2017, 134 UK Regular Armed Forces personnel were medically
discharged with a principal condition of epilepsy.
As at 1 January 2018, 292 serving UK Regular Armed Forces personnel were identified with epilepsy.
AFCS awards for a primary condition of epilepsy have been interpreted as cases of epilepsy with no
apparent cause. Between 1 April 2010 and 31 March 2017 there were no serving/ex-serving Armed
Forces personnel awarded compensation under the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme (AFCS) for a
primary condition of epilepsy. However, there were 37 personnel who were awarded compensation for
epilepsy which has either resulted from or is highly likely to result from a service attributable head/brain
injury. Please see the AFCS background notes for further information on the process for awarding claims
under the AFCS
Since 1 January 2010, a minimum of 39 UK Regular Armed Forces personnel, both serving and
veterans, were identified with epilepsy due to a trauma.
Please note, the numbers above are not mutually exclusive and some have been taken as numbers over
time whereas others are taken as at single points in time. Therefore it is not accurate to add these
numbers together.
Under section 16 of the Act (Advice and Assistance) you may find it useful to note:
Medical discharges due to epilepsy were identified as personnel who were medically discharged with a
principal cause of discharge coded as G40 in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and
Related Health Problems Tenth Revision (ICD-10)
Medical discharges are the result of a number of specialists (medical, occupational, psychological
personnel, etc.) coming to the conclusion that an individual is suffering from a medical condition that pre
empts their continued service in the Armed Forces. Statistics based on these discharges do not
represent measures of true morbidity or pathology. At best they indicate a minimum burden of ill-health
in the Armed Forces. Furthermore, the number and diversity of processes involved with administering a
medical discharge introduce a series of time lags, as well as impact on the quality of data recorded.
The information on medical discharges was sourced from electronic personnel records from DMICP and
manually entered paper documents from medical boards. The primary purpose of these medical
documents is to ensure the appropriate administration of each individual patient's discharge. Statistical
analysis and reporting is a secondary function.
DMICP was rolled out in 2007 and is the source of electronic, integrated healthcare records for primary
healthcare and some MOD specialist care providers
The number of UK Regular Armed Forces personnel with epilepsy was identified by searching for:
. Personnel with at least one Read code for epilepsy entered onto their electronic primary care
record (DMICP) between 1 January 2010 and 14 February 2018
Personnel who were awarded compensation for epilepsy under the Armed Forces Compensation
Scheme (AFCS) between 1 April 2010 and 31 March 2017
.
The number of UK Regular Armed Forces personnel with epilepsy due to a trauma was identified by
searching for:
Personnel with at least one Read code for traumatic epilepsy entered onto their electronic
primary care record (DMICP) between 1 January 2010 and 14 February 2018
. Personnel who were awarded compensation under the AFCS between 1 April 2010 and 31
March 2017 for epilepsy which has either resulted from or is highly likely to result from a service
attributable head/brain injury
The electronic patient record contains information that is Read coded. Read codes are a set of clinical
codes designed for Primary Care to record the everyday care of a Patient. They are part of a hierarchical
structure and form the recognised standard for General Practice. Searches for Read codes can be made
to identify personnel who had a particular medical condition
Please note, any data entered as free text only in patients' medical record will not be included in the
figures presented as this information is not available in the data warehouse. If data was entered as free
text in the medical record and personnel were not awarded compensation under the AFCS they would
not have been included in the figures. Therefore, the number of personnel with epilepsy and epilepsy
due to a trauma should be considered a minimum

Armed Forces Compensation Scheme (AFCS)
The Armed Forces and Reserve Forces Compensation Scheme (AFCS) came into force on 6 April 2005
to pay compensation for injury, illness or death attributable to Service that occurred on or after that
date. It replaced the previous compensation arrangements provided by the War Pensions Scheme
(WPS) and the attributable elements of the Armed Forces and Reserve Forces Pensions Scheme
Defence Statistics publish an annual National Statistic on claims and awards under the WPS1 and an
annual National Statistic on claims and awards under the AFCS2
Claimants' injuries/illnesses considered to be Service-attributable are awarded under the AFCS in line
with one of nine tariff of injury tables, which each cover the legislation surrounding the payment of
compensation: Table 1 Burns; Table 2 Injury, Wounds and Scarring; Table 3 - Mental Disorders;
Table 4 Physical Disorders; Table 5 Amputations; Table 6 Neurological Disorders; Table 7 - Senses;
Table 8 Fractures and Dislocations; and Table 9 Musculoskeletal Disorders.
The legislation surrounding the payment of compensation under each tariff of injury table also
determines the tariff level at which each injury/illness should be paid compensation. There are 15 tariff
levels which each attract a lump sum award. Tariff levels 1 11 also attract an ongoing Guaranteed
https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/war-pension-recipients-index
2 https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/armed-forces-compensation-scheme-statistics-index
Income Payment (GIP), a tax-free index-linked income stream known as the Guaranteed Income
Payment (GIP) is paid from service termination for life to recognise loss of future earnings due to the
injury or illness. The full tariff of injury tables and associated tariff levels are published online by Infolaw3
a publisher of legal resources.
The Independent Medical Expert Group (IMEG) advises the Minister for Defence Personnel and
Veterans on medical and scientific aspects of Armed Forces Compensation Scheme (AFCS) and related
matters. The IMEG considered the scheme's approach to epilepsy in their 2013 report. For further
information please see the 2013 report at the following link which gives further background to how epilepsy
is considered under the scheme: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/imeg-report-on-medical-and
scientific-aspects-of-the-armed-forces-compensation-scheme
Under the AFCS, where epilepsy was accepted as being attributable to Service due to a head or brain
injury, it was awarded as a neurological disorder. Post head/brain injury epilepsy can be awarded under
the following categories and tariff levels. The tariff level indicates the severity of the condition with lower
numerical values indicating the more severe injuries/illnesses;
. Brain injury with a high risk of epilepsy
awarded at tariff levels 1, 2 or 4. Brain injuries at these
most severe levels have a high risk of epilepsy and therefore the award includes compensation
for associated epilepsy, regardless of whether epilepsy is present at the time of the claim
Uncontrolled post head injury epilepsy - awarded at tariff level 4.
Controlled post head injury epilepsy- awarded at tariff level 12
.
.
AFCS data is sourced from the Compensation and Pension System (CAPS) which is administrated and
managed by DBS Veterans UK. Data were extracted from the CAPS as at 31 March 2017
