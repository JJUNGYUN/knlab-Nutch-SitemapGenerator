Crown Rights Agreement
(to make provision for the licensing of Crown copyright and
database rights to Ordnance Survey Limited and the
assignment to the Crown of copyright and database rights)
BETWEEN
THE KEEPER OF PUBLIC RECORDS
AND
ORDNANCE SURVEY LIMITED
DATE a ust 2017
This Crown Rights Agreement is made on the day of August 2017
Between
(1)The Keeper of Public Records, whose principal office is t The National Archives
Kew, Richmond, Surrey TW9 4DU (The Keeper); and
Ordnance Survey Limited, a company registered in England (company registration
number 09121572), whose registered office is at Explorer House, Adanac Drive
Nursling, Southampton, Hampshire, S016 0AS (Ordnance Survey Limited)
(2)
Background
In 2015, the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills determined that it
would be beneficial to restructure the organisation known as Ordnance Survey, by
converting it from a non-Ministerial government department operating as a trading
fund within the Department for Business Innovation and Skills (Ordnance Survey
Trading Fund) into a wholly owned government company limited by shares
Ordnance Survey Limited, a private company limited by shares, was therefore
incorporated under the Companies Act 2006. The entire issued share capital of
Ordnance Survey Limited is owned by the Department for Business, Energy and
Industrial Strategy (BEIS). All of the functions (including the role of national
mapping agency of Great Britain and the delivery of the Public Task) and assets of
Ordnance Survey Trading Fund were transferred to Ordnance Survey Limited on
the Transfer Date (as defined below)
Under legislation, Her Majesty the Queen is the first owner of all copyright and
database rights held by the Crown. As at the Transfer Date, HMSO (as defined
below) had been appointed by Her Majesty by Letters Patent to hold and administer
copyright and database rights belonging to the Crown on Her behalf
C
Prior to the Transfer Date, HMSO delegated to Ordnance Survey Trading Fund
under the Delegation of Authority (as defined below), the authority to use, re-use
and license Crown copyright and database rights in all material produced or
commissioned by Ordnance Survey Trading Fund
On the Transfer Date, as a result of the transfer referred to in B above, the
Delegation of Authority was revoked, but such copyright and database rights remain
vested in the Crown. The First Crown Rights Agreement (as defined below) set out
the terms under which Ordnance Survey Limited was licensed to use and re-use the
Material, and the terms on which Ordnance Survey Limited would assign certain
copyright and database rights to the Crown
E
Her Majesty has now revoked the Letters Patent previously granted to HMSO, and
has appointed the Keeper by Letters Patent dated 1 July 2017 to hold and
administer copyright and database rights belonging to the Crown on Her behalf.
This Agreement therefore makes provision for the handover from HMSO to the
Keeper and replaces the First Crown Rights Agreement with effect from the
Effective Date (as defined below)

Sustainable Operations Policy Statement
The Department for Education is committed to sustainable development and believes it is important to
prepare young people for the future. Our approach is based on the belief that schools perform better
when they take responsibility for their own improvement. We want schools to make their own
judgements on how sustainable development should be reflected in their ethos, day-to-day operations
and through education for sustainable development. Those judgements should be based on sound
knowledge and local needs.
We are also committed to reducing the environmental impact of our own operations. We will conduct
these to reflect, as far as practicable, best environmental, social and economic sustainability.
In particular, we shall:
comply with all applicable legislation, regulations and with other government requirements;
review our activities and operations regularly to identify environmental aspects and prioritise action to
address the impacts of these
maintain an Environmental Management System to pursue sustainability, continual improvement and
the prevention of pollution. We will keep this under regular review to ensure its robustness and fitness
for purpose
monitor and review performance and progress of government estate sustainability targets and any other
ocally set targets;
specifically, we will work towards reducing our carbon emissions from our properties and travel
reducing our waste and increase recycling, reducing water consumption and reducing our impact on the
surrounding environment
.
raise awareness of the sustainable operations agenda across the department through specific training,
performance information, and publication of this policy statement
share our experiences and expertise to assist others in the development of their own sustainable
development improvement plans;
ensure that procurement of goods and services supports our Sustainable Operations Policy, and
encourage suppliers and contractors to improve their own environmental performance;
report performance publicly in line with Cabinet Office and HM Treasury requirements.

This statement applies to the Department and its Executive Agencies, except where a local policy
statement has been agreed, and to all individuals working for, or on behalf of the Department.
The Department's overarching Environmental Management System will be managed in line with
ISO14001:2004 principles, and maintained by the Department's Sustainable Operations team. This

DECISIONS OF THE CERTIFICATION OFFICER ON AN APPLICATION MADE UNDER
SECTION 108A(1) OF THE TRADE UNION AND LABOUR RELATIONS
(CONSOLIDATION) ACT 1992
Mr Michael Rolfe
POA
Date of Decision
19 March 2018
DECISION
1. Upon application by Mr Rolfe "the claimant") under section 108A(1) of the Trade
Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 (the 1992 Act")
2. I grant the claimant's application for a declaration that on or around 3 May 2017 the
Union breached Rule 10.9 by disqualifying Mr Rolfe from holding a NEC position until
May 2026 when he had not resigned from office during his elected term but ceased to
be a member of the NEC after 3 May 2017 by virtue of resigning as a Prison Officer
and not being eligible for membership of the POA until re-joining on 9 June 2017.
3. I consider that it would be appropriate to make an enforcement order. I order that:
The NEC remove the disqualification of Mr Rolfe from holding any National
Executive post which was imposed on him under rule 10.9 following his
resignation as a Prison Officer on 3 May 2017. This order will take effect
from the date of this decision.
4. I dismiss complaints two and three upon withdrawal by Mr Rolfe on the day of the
hearing
REASONS
Mr Rolfe brought this application as a member of the POA ("the Union"). He did so by
a registration of complaint which was received at the Certification Office on 6 July
2017. He made a further two complaints on 19 September 2017.
5.
6. Following correspondence with my office, Mr Rolfe confirmed his complaints as
follows
Complaint 1
That on or around 3 May 2017 the union breached Rule 10.9 by disqualifying Mr Michael Rolfe
from holding a NEC position until May 2026 when he had not resigned from office during his
elected term but ceased to be a member of the NEC after 3 May 2017 by virtue of resigning as
a Prison Officer and not being eligible for membership of the POA until re-joining on 9 June
2017.
Complaint 2
That on or around 3 May 2017, the union breached its rule 10.7 by disqualifying Mr Michael
Rolfe from holding a NEC position until 9 June 2022 when he had not lapsed as a member of
the POA
Complaint 3
That on or around 3 May 2017, the union breached its rule 8.8 by determining Mr Michael Rolfe
was a lapsed member when he was not in arrears for at least 2 months
7. Immediately before the hearing Mr Rolfe withdrew complaints two and three. These
complaints were not, therefore, considered at the hearing and consequently I have
dismissed these.
8. At the hearing before me Mr Rolfe represented himself. A written witness statement
and oral evidence was given by Mr Rolfe. The Union was represented by Mr Peter
Edwards of Counsel. A written witness statement and oral evidence for the Union was
given by Mr Steve Gillan. There was also in evidence a bundle of documents
consisting of 441 pages containing correspondence and the rules of the Union. Both
the Union and the claimant provided skeleton arguments.
Findings of Fact
9. Having considered the written and oral evidence and the representations of the
parties, I find the facts to be as follows:
a. Mr Rolfe is a Prison Officer and a member of the POA. He was elected as
National Chair of the Union in November 2015 with his term of office running
until the end of the Union's Conference in 2021
b. Mr Rolfe was a Parliamentary candidate in the General Election in June 2017.
Once his candidature was accepted he was required to resign from his role as
a Prison Officer.
c. On 3 May 2017 Mr Rolfe informed the Union's NEC of his candidature, his
resignation from the Prison Service and the fact that he would no longer be a
full member of the Union nor a Member of the NEC
d. The Union treated this letter as Mr Rolfe's resignation as National Chair.
e. Mr Rolfe was unsuccessful in the General Election. He subsequently returned
to the Prison Service and re-joined the Union
2
f. On 19 June 2017, Mr Rolfe queried the Union's use of the word "resignation'"
in the Circular to Members 59/2017 issued on 3 May 2017. He said that he
did not resign from the Union nor from his role as National Chair.
g. The Union considered his views at its NEC meeting on 28 June 2017. The
NEC confirmed its view that Mr Rolfe had resigned as National Chair.
h. The Union also told Mr Rolfe that, as he had resigned from his post as Chair,
Rule 10.9 applied and Mr Rolfe was not eligible to stand for election to the
NEC until 2026

would have been due for re-electiorn
CONSIDERATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS
Summary of Submissions
12. Mr Rolfe and the POA have both presented this case to me as being a straightforward
interpretation of the Rules. They both contend that the position is clear, Mr Rolfe told
me that his membership of the Union ceased under Rule 4.2 as he no longer met the
eligibility requirements for full membership under rule 4.1(a) and as a consequence
he was no longer a member of the NEC or National Chair. His view is that he could
not have resigned as he had already ceased to be a member of the NEC and National
Chair of the Union. In his view, it is wrong to treat his letter of 3 May to the Union as a
resignation letter as he was not in a position to resign from the NEC once his Union
membership had ceased under Rule 4.2.
13. The Union is clear that Mr Rolfe's letter of 3 May could only have been a resignation
letter and that, whatever the intent, it was reasonable for the NEC to have treated it
as such. The Union also contend that Mr Rolfe's argument is highly technical and
unmeritorious and that accepting his argument would undermine the purpose of Rule
10.9.
Mr Rolfe
14. Mr Rolfe told me that Rule 10.9 does not apply to him. His position is that, having
decided to stand for Parliament, he was required to resign from the civil service. As a
consequence, he became ineligible for Union Membership under Rule 4.1(a) and
automatically ceased to be a member of the Union under Rule 4.2 and, consequently,
ceased to be a member of the NEC under Rule 10.8. He argues that these were

Port of Falmouth Development Initiative: maerl 'recovery' report
Aims
Provide independent expert opinion on likely 'recovery rates of maerl following proposed navigation
channel dredging in Falmouth Harbour.
Meet Nicola Solly at Royal Haskoning Exeter Office on 1t September 2009 to run through details
of the dredging proposals and maerl studies already undertaken
Review analyses that Royal Haskoning has undertaken of the maerl survey data
Review relevant sections of the Environmental Statement and supporting information
Supplement any knowledge from the existing scientific and grey literature
Provide expert opinion on likely 'recovery' rates (in terms of numbers of years) with a detailed
commentary explaining the reasoning behind this
Introduction
In this short report I provide independent expert advice on the rate at which maerl bed communities
within the proposed dredge area might re-colonise after deepening of the navigation channel if
mitigation measures are put in place. To do this I have examined the most relevant parts of the Port of
Falmouth Development Initiative Environmental Statement (31 July 2009), namely Chapters 1
(Introduction), 2 (Project Description), 5 (Hydrodynamic and sediment regime), 8 (Coastal ecology), 24
(Implications for the designated status of the Fal and Helford Estuaries SAC) and Appendix C (Marine
Ecology) In addition I have examined the raw data and analyses carried out in house by Royal
Haskoning to assess post-dredging maerl recovery rates within the Fal Estuary (Royal Haskoning, 2004
2008). I report on my opinions of Chapters 8 and 24 of the Environmental Statement and the maerl
monitoring assessments provided by Royal Haskoning (2004, 2008)
1
Chapter 8 Marine and Coastal Ecolo
Chapter 8 argues that the proposed capital dredging would have 'major adverse impact' unless
the proposed mitigation plan was implemented, but that if maerl is replaced on the seabed at the
eastern end of the navigation channel then the proposal would have 'minor adverse residual impact
This Chapter first describes how the proposed capital dredging would cause loss of live maerl
and that without mitigation this would result in the loss of approximately four hectares of maerl gravel
habitat. Given the scale of this loss and the sensitivity of the SAC, the Environmental Statement asserts
that this would represent a ‘major adverse impact. This is because the proposed dredging site lies
within an SAC where maerl habitats that are 1000s of years old (Hall-Spencer 1998, Bosence & Wilson,
2003) are one of the primary features of conservation importance as they are rare around the coasts of
England. Maerl is a UK listed priority habitat and its Biodiversity Action Plan states the objectives of
maintaining its range, variety and quality. Tyler & Hiscock (2005) are cited as noting that maerl is 'highly
intolerant' of 'substratum loss", ‘smothering', 'changes in suspended sediment, and 'abrasion and
physical disturbance'. Hall-Spencer et a (2006) and Nelson (2009) provide updates on the
environmental tolerances of maerl which strengthen the body of scientific evidence that these habitats
are intolerant of substratum loss, smothering, changes in suspended sediment, abrasion and physical
disturbance. The Environmental Statement argues that increased sedimentation due to the proposed
dredging is expected to have a 'minor adverse impact' on the surrounding maerl and its associated
benthic infauna. I agree with the arguments that the live maerl beds located off St Mawes would
probably not be affected by the proposed dredging. However, given the weight of published evidence
showing the vulnerability of live maerl to smothering with silt, I would anticipate that any live maerl
adjacent to the proposed dredging channel would be killed (i.e. major adverse impact') I consider that
the planned use of a backhoe dredger for channel deepening is a good choice as this will suspend less
sediment than suction dredging. estimate that this will restrict the smothering of live maerl to a 20 m
zone around the dredge channel, based on a combination of my knowledge of the effects of siltation on
live maerl caused by scallop dredging (Hall-Spencer & Moore, 2000) and an examination of Chapter 5 of
the Environmental Statement (Hydrodynamic and sediment regime)
To mitigate the impact of dredging it is proposed that coarse maerl gravel (i.e. maerl with a low
silt content) from the central/western part of the proposed dredging area be redistributed over an
estimated 6 hectare area of seabed at the eastern end of the proposed dredge channel in a layer 1 m
thick. Annex C of the Environmental Statement (Axelsson et al. 2008) shows that live maerl was
recorded in 8/10 of the core samples taken from the proposed dredging channel, with abundant live
maerl in 2/10 samples and frequent live maerl in 3/10 of the samples. Chapter 8 of the Environmental
Statement acknowledges that live maerl in the dredged area will be killed, but the idea behind the
proposed mitigation plan is to use a backhoe dredge to put dead maerl back to allow recolonisation of
maerl communities and to help reduce dredging effects from 'major adverse impact' to a 'minor adverse
residual impact. Such classifications are subjective however, Natural England may argue that the loss of
a mature maerl community with scattered live maerl remains a 'major adverse impact' despite the
proposed mitigation efforts. Axelsson et al. (2008) found that the sedimentary habitat within the
proposed dredging footprint had the high species richness that is typical of maerl-associated
communities. They also found that this area has the only known UK records of the tanaidacean
Leptognathis paramanca, a species which is being considered for statutory conservation protection. In
my opinion L. paramanca may be widespread in maerl deposits within the Fal and Helford SAC but may
have gone unnoticed as many previous surveys of this habitat did not identify specimens to species level
(e.g. Royal Haskoning 2004, 2008). Use of a backhoe dredge to place maerl onto the seabed is a good
choice as this will reduce the impact of plumes of suspended sediment which would otherwise be
expected if the maerl was simply dumped overboard. While the dredged maerl is stored on barges I
would expect the sediment to become anoxic as the inhabitants of the maerl die and rot, raising
concerns about the rate at which this anoxic sediment might take to recolonise
I agree with the advice within the Environmental Statement that, if navigation channel dredging
goes ahead, then the proposed mitigation exercise is a valid attempt to avoid adverse impacts on the
integrity of the Fal and Helford SAC. I also agree with the recommendation that the coarse maerl gravel
be redistributed in a layer 1 m thick. This is because long-lived elements of the fauna that typify
established maerl communities are known to burrow deeply (70 cm) into maerl deposits (Hall-Spencer
& Atkinson, 1999). I would caution that it is difficult to predict whether the mitigation will work,
especially since translocation of maerl habitat has not been attempted before. We can not assume that
the granulometry of the coarse maerl gravel laid onto the proposed overdredged area at the eastern
end of the channel will not be altered by the subsequent build-up of sand and/or silt. Given that sand
and silty maerl gravel sediments are present in the proposed mitigation area at present (Chapter 5), my
opinion is that coarse maerl gravel could become inundated by other sediment types over the coming
decades and that as a consequence the coarse maerl gravel habitat type that would be removed from
the central/western part of the proposed dredging channel would be lost in perpetuity
Chapter 8 posits that a 'relatively small proportion of dead maerl habitat within the SAC is likely
to be affected. It would be useful to know how this estimate was reached as 1) live maerl wil be
removed and killed, and 2) an estimate of % loss of maerl habitat within the SAC has not been
attempted. A GIS map of the known live and dead areas of maerl habitat within the SAC would help
enlighten discussions and decisions about the proposal as it and may strengthen (or weaken) the
argument that the proposed dredging programme will not affect the integrity of the SAC.
Maerl 'recover
No data exist on the recovery of maerl beds that have been dredged from one place and put in
another, although there have been assessments of the ecological consequences of the disposal of other
types of dredged material around the coastline of England and Wales that show that the communities
within such sites generally have an impoverished fauna, although the degree of impact is highly site-
specific (Bolam et al. 2006). On the basis of published work on the effects of dredging on maerl bed
ecology (de Grave & Whitaker 2000; Hall-Spencer & Moore 2000; Hauton et al. 2003) I consider it likely
that moving a maerl bed would have strong effects on the structure and composition of the community
that eventually becomes established within the translocated sediment. The benthic community is
unlikely to return to the same community composition as that found in the central/western end of the
proposed dredging channel as there will be long-term effects of the disturbance itself (e.g. death of live
maerl upon which maerl generation ultimately depends) as well as differences in parameters such as
wave exposure, currents and sediment granulometry that will determine the eventual composition of
the benthic community. However, it may be that a different and yet ecologically healthy maerl
community could develop over time thanks to mitigation, where useful ecosystem goods and services
are provided by the translocated maerl. agree with McCauley (1977) that 'recovery is the wrong term
to use when studying post-dredging re-colonisation processes as it not only implies a return to prior
abundance levels, but also a return to ecological pathways which may have taken years to develop. In
an analysis of re-colonization processes following cessation of maerl dredging in Ireland, De Grave &
Whitaker (2000) found clear differences in the benthos between dredged and fallow sites but they were
unable to determine whether there had been a return to pre-dredging conditions as there were no pre-
dredge data. However, they noted that several studies on other sediment types had shown changes in
the relative contribution of the major taxonomic groups following dredging abatement

Chapter 8 assesses the likely rates of re-colonization of maerl in the mitigation zone, based on
data analyses by Royal Haskoning (2004, 2008) and Axellson et al. (2008). Royal Haskoning (2004)
compares hand-held core samples taken in July 2003 with those taken in July 2004 at maerl sites within
the Fal 1) that had never been dredged, 2) where low-levels of maerl extraction had occurred in 2003-4,
3) where levels of maerl extraction increased to high levels in 2003-4 and 4) where maerl extraction had
ceased in 2003, following a previous 15 year period of dredging. Their analyses show the high degree of
inter-annual variability that can be obtained in core sample studies of maerl beds, even if the sampling
season is standardised. Within the undredged areas, for instance, the abundance of fauna at some
stations dropped by two thirds in July 2004 (cf. July 2003) whereas at another reference station the
abundance of fauna had increased over the same time period. Royal Haskoning (2004) also show the
marked effect that high levels of maerl extraction can have, transforming an area of maerl that was the
richest area recorded in 2003 (76 taxa) to the most impoverished benthic community in 2004 (15 taxa)
These data are consistent with what would be expected in heavily dredged areas. At all of the other
sites studied there was such a high variability in numbers of taxa and their abundances that no
significant trends from 2003-2004. At the site where maerl extraction had ceased in 2003, two of the
three stations sampled showed increases in the average numbers of taxa and abundances of organisms
per core but these increases were not statistically significant. Royal Haskoning (2004) recommended
that longer-term monitoring of the maerl was needed to assess 'recovery' of the communities present
Given the variability in the abundances of the species that occur in maerl core samples it may be
sensible to consider the functional capacity (or health) of these ecosystems rather than simply the range
and proportions of species present (see Cooper et al., 2008). One way in which this could be measures
is to use air-lift sampling to assess the population structure of long-lived infauna such as the brood stock
of adult bivalves
I have not carried out ecological studies of maerl deposits within the Fal and Helford Estuary SAC
so have to draw on my experience of studies of maerl habitats in Brittany and Scotland to inform my
opinion of the Environmental Assessment. During the course of these studies I have learnt that replicate
15 cm long, 11 cm diameter hand-held core samples provide a good means of monitoring the small and
abundant sessile fauna that occur in surface sediments (e.g. Davies et al. 2001; Hall-Spencer & Bamber,
2007). However, this sampling methodology is not suited to an assessment of large, long-lived
inhabitants of maerl beds which are more sparsely distributed and often occur below the depth to which
hand-held diver cores can penetrate. Axelsson et al. (2008) noted that biomass records were extremely
variable within the proposed dredge area, and depended on whether large organisms such as Paphia

types of dredged material around the coastline of England and Wales that show that the communities
within such sites generally have an impoverished fauna, although the degree of impact is highly site-

that moving a maerl bed would have strong effects on the structure and composition of the community

unlikely to return to the same community composition as that found in the central/western end of the

Chapter 8 assesses the likely rates of re-colonization of maerl in the mitigation zone, based on
data analyses by Royal Haskoning (2004, 2008) and Axellson et al. (2008). Royal Haskoning (2004)
compares hand-held core samples taken in July 2003 with those taken in July 2004 at maerl sites within
the Fal 1) that had never been dredged, 2) where low-levels of maerl extraction had occurred in 2003-4,
3) where levels of maerl extraction increased to high levels in 2003-4 and 4) where maerl extraction had
ceased in 2003, following a previous 15 year period of dredging. Their analyses show the high degree of
inter-annual variability that can be obtained in core sample studies of maerl beds, even if the sampling
season is standardised. Within the undredged areas, for instance, the abundance of fauna at some
stations dropped by two thirds in July 2004 (cf. July 2003) whereas at another reference station the
abundance of fauna had increased over the same time period. Royal Haskoning (2004) also show the
marked effect that high levels of maerl extraction can have, transforming an area of maerl that was the
richest area recorded in 2003 (76 taxa) to the most impoverished benthic community in 2004 (15 taxa)
These data are consistent with what would be expected in heavily dredged areas. At all of the other
sites studied there was such a high variability in numbers of taxa and their abundances that no
significant trends from 2003-2004. At the site where maerl extraction had ceased in 2003, two of the
three stations sampled showed increases in the average numbers of taxa and abundances of organisms
per core but these increases were not statistically significant. Royal Haskoning (2004) recommended
that longer-term monitoring of the maerl was needed to assess 'recovery' of the communities present
Given the variability in the abundances of the species that occur in maerl core samples it may be
sensible to consider the functional capacity (or health) of these ecosystems rather than simply the range
and proportions of species present (see Cooper et al., 2008). One way in which this could be measures
is to use air-lift sampling to assess the population structure of long-lived infauna such as the brood stock
of adult bivalves
I have not carried out ecological studies of maerl deposits within the Fal and Helford Estuary SAC
so have to draw on my experience of studies of maerl habitats in Brittany and Scotland to inform my
opinion of the Environmental Assessment. During the course of these studies I have learnt that replicate
15 cm long, 11 cm diameter hand-held core samples provide a good means of monitoring the small and
abundant sessile fauna that occur in surface sediments (e.g. Davies et al. 2001; Hall-Spencer & Bamber,
2007). However, this sampling methodology is not suited to an assessment of large, long-lived
inhabitants of maerl beds which are more sparsely distributed and often occur below the depth to which
hand-held diver cores can penetrate. Axelsson et al. (2008) noted that biomass records were extremely
variable within the proposed dredge area, and depended on whether large organisms such as Paphia

Solly, N.S. (Royal Haskoning) and Knowles, H (Falmouth Harbour Commissioners
25/11/2009
1. Brief:
The purpose of this study was to calcułate the surface area of maerl habitat in the Fal and
Helford Special Area of Conservation (SAC) using existing data sources on the distribution of
maerl within the area. This is being undertaken to inform the discussions on the FEPA
license currently under consideration for the Port of Falmouth Development Initiative
(PFDI), which includes dredging of maerl within the Fal estuary.
2. Methodology:
The assessment was carried out using existing data on the distribution of maerl within the
SAC. The following surveys/ data sources were used (no new survey work was carried out
for this assessment);
. Davies and Sotheran, 1995;
» Hardiman et al, 1976;
» Ruiz-Frau et al, 2007 on behalf of Cornish Sea Fisheries Commission; and
SeaStar Survey 2007.
This study has concentrated on the distribution of dead rather than live maerl. This is
because the maerl beds that will be affected by the PDFI comprise predominantly dead
maerl with a small proportion of live maerl on the surface. The live maerl bank off St Mawes
is not predicted to be affected by the scheme (see the PFDI Environmental Statement (Royal
Haskoning, 2009) for further details)
Using EasyCAD 7 software, a map was produced showing the locations where dead maerl
has been record as being present or absent. In order to estimate the area of maerl within
the SAC, it was decided to map the areas where dead maerl is the dominant sediment on
the seabed. This was defined as being locations where dead maerl has been recorded as
comprising at least 50% of the sediment recorded at a sampling location or the survey had
recorded it as being the dominant substrate (further detail presented below).
2.1Analysing abundance
2.1.1 DAFOR method
Two of the investigations (SeaStar Survey, 2007 and Hardiman et al, 1976) visually assessed
the nature of the sediments on the seabed and classified the abundance of maerl according
to the well-known DAFOR scale. The percentage cover of maerl on the seabed at each
sampling station was described according to the following classification:
D-dominant->75% maerl cover
A-abundant-51-75% maerl cover
F-frequent-26-50% maerl cover
O-occasional 11-25% maerl cover
R-rare-0-10% maerl cover
For the purposes of this study, all sampling stations where maerl was recorded as being
dominant or abundant (i.e. more than 50%) were included.
2.1.2 Davies and Sotheran
The Davies and Sotheran investigation mapped the distribution of maerl and other habitats
in the SAC. The study was undertaken using RoxAnn acoustic system supported by direct
observation of the sea bed using drop-down video camera and sediment samples collected
by grab. At each of the video and grab stations, the seabed was classified according to the
biotope present. Twelve biotopes were recorded in total of which 4 recorded are
considered to be dominated by maerl. These were biotope codes 4, 5, 6 and 7 referred to in
Table 1 of the report. Locations where these biotopes were present were therefore
included in this study as maerl is considered to be the dominant sediment in these locations.
2.1.3 CFSC study
The CSFC study involved grab sampling at eight stations and taking video recording along six
transects. Only the grab sampling data is presented in the report in sufficient detail to be
able to use in this assessment. Locations where the sediment types for the grab samples
were described as maerl gravel, were included in the study.
2.2
Mapping of areas
Figure 1 shows the locations where maerl is recorded as being dominant. In order to
estimate the area of maerl, a series of polygons were drawn around these locations in
EasyCAD. These were drawn using the following assumptions:
Where there are two stations recorded as maerl being dominant, it is assumed that
maerl dominates the sediments between these two stations
It is assumed that the boundary between maerl being present and absent lies
equidistant between stations where maerl is being recorded as present and absent
It should be noted that in practise one sediment type is likely to gradually grade into
another often with a poorly defined boundary
o
Using these polygons, the predicted area of maerl was calculated. This has been compared
he area of the Fal and Helford SAC to estimate the percentage cover of the maerl
hapitat.
In light of how the results of this study will be used, it is important that a pre-cautionary
approach is adopted and that the area of maerl is not over-estimated. It is was therefore
decided to apply a scaling factor to the results of the study to account for the fact that there
is likely to be natural variability in the sediment types across the study area and that despite
the best efforts to map the distribution accurately, it is likely that maerl is not present
continuously across the areas where maerl is recorded as being dominant. A scaling factor
of 30% was therefore used and the calculated areas were multiplied by 0.7 to reduce them
by this factor.
It should be noted that although maerl is not likely to be present 100% continuously across
the identified areas, maerl is also likely to be present outside of these areas, which has not
been recorded by any of the surveys due to the distances between sampling stations.
Therefore the results of this study probably represent an underestimate of the
maerl within the SAC.

3. Results:
The results of the assessment are presented in Figure 1 and Table 1. The results of the
assessment have been compared to the biotope map in Davies and Sotheran (1994). They
appear broadly consistent with Davies and Sotheran (1994) who recorded that "Falmouth
Bay was predominantly sedimentary with the sediment mainly dead maerl or maeri derivatives".
Each polygon where maerl is predicted to be dominant was identified with a number (1-4)
and the area of each is identified in Table 1. The total area of dead maerl within the SAC is
962 hectares (including a 30% scaling factor). The SAC covers an area of 6397 hectares
(JNCC, [online]) and therefore, the percentage of the Fal and Helford SAC covered by dead
maerl is approximately 15%

Dear Nicola
Re Information for Appropriate Assessment on Port of Falmouth Development Initiative
Thank you for your draft report dated 20h May 2010 setting out the information required by
Falmouth Harbour Commissioners and Falmouth Docks and Engineering Company to
produce an appropriate assessment
In my letter to the Marine & Fisheries Agency dated 15th September 2009, I set out details of
three areas of concern regarding the likely impact of the proposed dredge and replacement
of maerl, namely:
. Destruction of the maerl matrix
.
.
.
Burying of live maerl
Predicted rates of sedimentation
Over optimistic rates of recovery
In the 20h May document Royal Haskonning suggests in the conclusion that "... it is open to
FHC and FDEC to conclude that the PFDI will not have an adverse effect on the integrity of
the Fal & Helford SAC " . This is based on the estimate that less than 2% of dead maerl
within the SAC will be affected by the proposals and only in the medium term." As Relevant
Authorities, FHC and FDEC are at liberty to draw their own conclusions in their appropriate
assessment following consultation with Natural England. However we would advise that we
believe that the argument of no adverse effect on the integrity of the site based on the
percentage impacted is false. Previous case law supports this, for example in the decision
regarding Barksore Marshes in Kent, the planning inspector concluded
" I am aware of no policy guidance to suggest that even small losses (of, say 5% or
1%) of a valued habitat within an SPA should be regarded as acceptable."
As the maerl deposits have a limited European distribution, and the Fal and Helford SAC
represents the only significant occurrence of such habitats in England, Natural England
believe that the potential losses due to the dredge and replacement of maerl as part of the
PFDI cannot be regarded as insignificant
It is further argued by Royal Haskonning that integrity of the SAC will be maintained as the
extent of maerl within the SAC will be preserved by the replacement of dredged maerl with
maerl re-deposited at the eastern section of the dredge area. Indeed, it is further argued that
the area of pure maerl will be increased as a result of the dredge and replacement. Royal
Haskonning argue that "...neither habitat (of maerl) is more valuable than the other.
In the Fal and Helford Management scheme, agreed to and signed by FHC and FDEC,
Conservation Objective 3 (part of the regulation 33 advice package) is "To maintain thee
SUBTIDAL SANDBANKS in 'favourable condition', taking account of natural change, with
particular reference to
. Eelgrass bed communities
. Maerl bed communities
. Gravel and sand communities
. Mixed sediment communities
The Fal and Helford Management scheme clearly states in the section Subtidal sandbanks
that in order to meet the above objectives, relevant and competent authorities are advised to
manage activities within their remit such that they do not result in
removal and/or smothering
physical damage resulting from siltation, abrasion and/or selective extraction
.
increased synthetic and/or non-synthetic toxic contamination
nutrient and/or organic enrichment
*
. increases in turbidity
The assessment criteria for the favourable condition of the Maerl bed communities (Table 5
of the Fal and Helford Management scheme) is set out in the attached Table
While we would agree that the proposed plan to replace the maerl is likely to maintain the
extent criteria we would argue that the impact of the dredge and replace will adversely
impact both the distribution of maerl bed communities and the species composition of maerl
bed communities attributes, contrary to the conservation objectives for the site, as set out

In the 20h May document Royal Haskonning suggests in the conclusion that "... it is open to
FHC and FDEC to conclude that the PFDI will not have an adverse effect on the integrity of
the Fal & Helford SAC " . This is based on the estimate that less than 2% of dead maerl
within the SAC will be affected by the proposals and only in the medium term." As Relevant
Authorities, FHC and FDEC are at liberty to draw their own conclusions in their appropriate
assessment following consultation with Natural England. However we would advise that we
believe that the argument of no adverse effect on the integrity of the site based on the
percentage impacted is false. Previous case law supports this, for example in the decision
regarding Barksore Marshes in Kent, the planning inspector concluded
" I am aware of no policy guidance to suggest that even small losses (of, say 5% or
1%) of a valued habitat within an SPA should be regarded as acceptable."
As the maerl deposits have a limited European distribution, and the Fal and Helford SAC
represents the only significant occurrence of such habitats in England, Natural England
believe that the potential losses due to the dredge and replacement of maerl as part of the
PFDI cannot be regarded as insignificant
It is further argued by Royal Haskonning that integrity of the SAC will be maintained as the
extent of maerl within the SAC will be preserved by the replacement of dredged maerl with
maerl re-deposited at the eastern section of the dredge area. Indeed, it is further argued that
the area of pure maerl will be increased as a result of the dredge and replacement. Royal
Haskonning argue that "...neither habitat (of maerl) is more valuable than the other.
In the Fal and Helford Management scheme, agreed to and signed by FHC and FDEC,
Conservation Objective 3 (part of the regulation 33 advice package) is "To maintain thee
SUBTIDAL SANDBANKS in 'favourable condition', taking account of natural change, with
particular reference to
. Eelgrass bed communities
. Maerl bed communities
. Gravel and sand communities
. Mixed sediment communities
The Fal and Helford Management scheme clearly states in the section Subtidal sandbanks
that in order to meet the above objectives, relevant and competent authorities are advised to
manage activities within their remit such that they do not result in
removal and/or smothering
physical damage resulting from siltation, abrasion and/or selective extraction
.

nutrient and/or organic enrichment
*
. increases in turbidity
The assessment criteria for the favourable condition of the Maerl bed communities (Table 5
of the Fal and Helford Management scheme) is set out in the attached Table
While we would agree that the proposed plan to replace the maerl is likely to maintain the
extent criteria we would argue that the impact of the dredge and replace will adversely
impact both the distribution of maerl bed communities and the species composition of maerl
bed communities attributes, contrary to the conservation objectives for the site, as set out

Food and Environmental Protection Act 1985 / Coast Protection Act - Application for
Capital Dredge and replacement of maerl, Falmouth Harbour
Thank you for your letter dated 19 August, received 21 August, together with the CD containing
the Environmental Statement regarding the proposed dredge and repla
deposits from Falmouth Harbour.
cement of maerl
We can confirm that the proposed dredge and deposition site is located within the boundary
of the Fal / Helford SAC, an area designated as a European site of conservation importance
under the provision of the Conservation (Natural Habitats &c.) Reguiations, 1994
can confirm that, following an appraisal of the evidence presented in the extensive
documentation supplied by Royal Haskonning in support of this proposed development, Natural
England considers that the proposal is likely to have a significant effect on the designated
features of the SAC and therefore requires an appropriate assessment. Natural England is
of the_ view that there is_sufficient information_contained within the Environmental
Statement for Marine & Fisheries Agency to undertake an Appropriate Assessmen
the Conservation (Natural Habitats &c) Regulations 1994
t under
The dredge area is largely composed of maerl habitat, listed as a sub-feature of Subtidal
Sandbanks that forms part of the SAC designation
The following is included from the Fal & Helford SAC Management Document
Maerl beds are composed of accumulations of living and dead unattached coralline
algae. Live maerl is pink and is found in the largest quantities in England and Wales on
St. Mawes Bank and offers shelter to a large number of other species of plants and
animals. There are also extensive areas of dead maeri and these sediments are also
species rich and provide an important habitat for deep burrowing species, attached
seaweed and large areas of brittle stars
The proposed dredge seeks to remove up to 60,000 cubic meters of predominantly maerl
sediment and use this to "recreate" maeri habitat in polygons 17, 18, 20 & 21 (as identified in
Figure 2-3 of the Environmental Statement). This area was surveyed by Seastar (Axelsson et
al. 2008) who reported on a number of survey stations. The relevant stations from the Seastar
survey Characterised the various polygons as being composed of between 50 and 80+% dead
maerl with between 1 and 10% live maerl
Natural England have specific concerns regarding this plan namely
Destruction of the maerl matrix
It is planned to remove the maerl sediment by use of a backhoe dredge, store the material on
barge, over dredge the non maerl material to ensure that the required depth of channel is
reached, then replace the maerl sediment by way of backhoe or hose. Natural England believe
that the action of maerl sediment removał, storage and replacement will break up the sediment
matrix, increase the level of fine material thus altering the overall sediment composition, and
significantly alter the character of the sediment matrix
. IE, the action of dredging the maerl
ediment will destroy the matrix that comprises the valuable habitat listed as a sub feature of
the SAC designation. It will also destroy the small amount of live maerl up to 10% currently
recorded on the sediment surface. It has been suggested (Hall-Spencer, 2009) that a
maerl both within the dredge area and across a 20m zone around the dredge area will die a
result of the dredging. This in itself constitutes a major adverse impact.
Predicted rates of sedimentation
The proposed sites for placement of maerl (polygons 17,1820 & 21) are all on the eastern
edge of the channel. The work done by HR Wallingford (Appendix A of the Environmental
Statement) on the predicted sediment movement post dredging. Figure 6.6 of that report give
the predicted annual sand infill across the whole of the proposed channel. Polygons 17 & 21
to experience up to 1m of sediment erosion while polygons 18 & 20 are predicted
to experience up to 1m of sediment deposition. This large amount of sediment movement is
likely to reduce any "beneficia" replacement of maerl and hinder further the recovery of the
sediment matrix
These changes in the sediment regime have been identified by Hali-Spencer as impeding the
recovery of both the
live maerl and the maerl sediment matrix with its associated biodiversity
Over optimistic rates of recovery
Natural England believe that the estimated rate of recovery of the habitat of between 2-5 years
as stated in the Environmental Statement is over optimistic.

much greater impact on the habitat, and previous studies do not enable sufficient certainty on
the potential recovery of habitat.

The review of the potential for maert recovery undertaken by Jason Hall Spencer, on behalf of
Royal Haskonning, places further doubt on the assessment of recovery of 2-5 years stated in
the Environmental Statement. The report highlights the impact

lled by the
dredging and storage. These organisms would then begin to decompose causing the maerl
deposits to become anoxic, hindering any recovery
tn summarising the likely recovery rates, Hall-Spencer states that the maerl will not recover in
thi ted 2-5 years and further states "...I would not expect a mature maerl community to
becuie established for 20-50 years, if at al.
On the basis of the above information, Natural England advises that the proposed dredge and
deposition would lead to an adverse impact on the Sandbank features of the Fal and Helford
SAC, and as such consent cannot be granted without following the process outlined in the
Conservation (Natural Habitats &c.) Regulations, 1994.
If, after having carried out an Appropriate Assessment, you are minded to issue the FEPA
licence, we request the chance to comment on the conclusions of that Assessment, prior to the
icence being issued.

Dear Nicola,
Port of Falmouth Development Initiative
Thank you for your letter dated 25th November giving your response to my letter to the Marine and
Fisheries Agency in which set out Natural England's views of the proposed dredge and replacement of
maerl sediments. Thank you also for including a copy of the briefing document dated 25h November sent
to Mark Sampson & Mike Reynolds
We have been discussing the issues you raise in your letter and our promise of further advice regarding
what would constitute a significant loss of maerl habitat and have the following advice
Under article 6.2 of the 1992 Habitats Directive there is a duty to "Avoid deterioration of habitats and
significant disturbance." You have raised the question as to what constitutes a significant disturbance to
the maerl sub-feature of the Fal & Helford SAC. In your letter, based on the mapping work undertaken by
yourself and Harriet Knowles, you estimate that the dredging will impact 2% of the total maerl present
within the SAC. In determining the likely significant impact of a plan or project on the integrity of a site or
feature of a site, the ECJ 7/9/04 Ruling on the Waddenzee Cockle Fishing (The Waddenzee Ruling)
stated that a likeliness to impact should be determined as requiring an
cannot be excluded, on the basis of objective information, that it will have a significant effect on the site
if it
As part of the Integrity test the precautionary principle in the Conservation (Natural Habitats &c)
Regulations 1994 (The Habs. Regs.) says that for the regulator to ensure there would be no harm, it can
only issue consent "only after having ascertained that the plan or project will not adversely affect the
integrity of the European site." This is further backed by the statement that the Competent Authority
should be "certain" about the lack of adverse effects
The problem we have in determining extent of the possible adverse impact of the proposed dredge and
replacement of the maerl sediment matrix is there have been no previous attempts at such a project
Given this lack of data on this type of operation, the ambiguity regarding the recovery rate and the
identified habitat loss, it must be concluded that the proposed plan could lead to an adverse impact on
the integrity of the SAC. Furthermore, it is not possible to allocate a number to what percentage of loss /
area impacted could be considered as acceptable and not likely to have an adverse impact on the
integrity of the SAGC
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or require further information
