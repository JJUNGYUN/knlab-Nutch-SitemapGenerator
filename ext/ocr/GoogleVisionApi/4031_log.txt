Commonwealth Ombudsman's submission to the Senate Committee Inquiry into violence, abuse a
neglect of people with disability in residential and institutional settings
BACKGROUND
The office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman was established in Australia by the
Ombudsman Act 1976. The Commonwealth Ombudsman safeguards the community in its
dealings with Australian Government agencies by
correcting administrative deficiencies through independent review of complaints about
Australian Government administrative action
fostering good public administration that is accountable, lawful, fair, transparent and
responsive
assisting people to resolve complaints about government administrative action
developing policies and principles for accountability
reviewing statutory compliance by agencies
The Commonwealth Ombudsman's unique position in the Australian administrative law
landscape provides us with an understanding of many individual experiences of members of
the public, who are dissatisfied with the way that government has dealt with their issue. The
Commonwealth Parliament has given the Ombudsman's office the power to investigate those
complaints by obtaining records and information from the agency that would not ordinarily be
available to a person acting on their own behalf. The office also engages with peak bodies
and community representatives to gain an understanding of the experience of their
constituencies in dealing with government
Over time, through investigating complaints about the actions of Commonwealth agencies
and speaking to the community about their experiences, the Ombudsman's office is able to
build up a detailed picture of those agencies' operations
RESPONSE TO TERMS OF REFERENCE
The Ombudsman's office welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the Committee's Inquiry
into violence, abuse and neglect of people with disability in residential and institutional
settings. We provide the following comments based on our experience in dealing with
complaints and our work in anticipation of the development of a national quality and
safeguarding framework for participants of the National Disability Insurance Scheme (
(terms of reference (I) and (m)
NDIS)
The Ombudsman's role
The Commonwealth Ombudsman has jurisdiction to consider complaints about the
administrative actions of Australian Government departments and agencies, as well as the
delivery of services by contracted service providers for and on behalf of the Australian
Government
At present, state and territory bodies are responsible for oversight of the delivery of the
majority of goods, services and daily interactions with which people with disability in
residential and institutional care are engaged
Notwithstanding the significant role that states and territories play in handling complaints
from people with disability in residential and institutional care, there are two areas of the
Commonwealth Ombudsman's jurisdiction that are of particular relevance to this Inquiry
They include jurisdiction in relation to the National Disability Insurance Agency and its

from consultations we have had with community groups in the disability and aged care
sectors and from complaints we did not investigate

necdotal feedback
Although we are not in a position to verify the claims, analysis of this a
reveals a number of themes such as
under-staffing and/or under-resourcing of residential aged care and disability facilities
particularly in those sections of a facility where the type or severity of the resid
disability is such that they are unaware their care is being compromised and/or are
unable to complain
ents'
overmedicating residents as a method of restraint, particularly those residents with
intellectual disability or cognitive impairment that makes their behaviour difficult or
unpredictable
.
the inability of residents (or the family or carer on their behalf) to obtain a suitable,
violence,
alternative residential aged care or disability placement, in order to escape
abuse or neglect; particularly where the resident has high care needs
We also note and support the general findings and recommendations set out in the Victoriarn
Ombudsman's recent report into Reporting and investigation of allegations of abuse in the
disability sector: Phase 1 - the effectiveness of statutory oversight. June 2015
Visibility of violence, abuse and neglect in complaints
There are a number of reasons why this office (and others) may not receive specific or direct
complaints from, or on behalf of people with disability in residential and institution
who experience v

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Mr H complained to my office that hls confidentlality had been breached by Australia
Post.
Mr H had complained to Australia Post both about a card that had beon left in hls
mall box in relation to a parcel; and about an incident in which he said the local
Postal Delvery Offioer (PDO) had been drinking alcohol on her round.
In the course of Australia Post's investigation, Australia Post offlcers contacted local
police to ask questions about Mr H's character. They also, in asking the PDO about
the allegatlons, showed her a record of the complaint which identified Mr H. Mr H has
subsequently alleged that the PDO has visited his residen
acted in a harassing and threatening manner.
ce and place of work and
Investigation of Mr H's complaint by Ombudsman staff showed that Australla Post did
not have a comprehensive slngle record of Mr H's contacis wit
that its staff took in response to them.
h it nor of the actions
There was a flow-on effect when Mr H complained to Australla Post that his
confidentiality had been breached. Australia Post's Chlef Privaoy Officer became
involved, but in reaching his concluslons he had to rely on Information about Australa
Post's actions glven to hlm by another staff member- Information which was not
complote or accurate.
Nor, It appears, does Australia Post have guldelines available to staff about how to
handle more difficult or sensitive complaints, Its existing guidelines do not
differentiate between complaints about missing mall tems and complaints, such as
the present, about staff misconduct.
I have concluded that Australla Post's complaint management systems are not in
accordance with best practice in that there is no single, a
complaint is handled. I have also concluded that the lack of guidelines on complairt
handling is not in accordance with best practice, and led to the two major deficiencle:s
in the investigation of Mr H's complaint: the disclosure of his identlty to the PDO, and
what I consider to have been an Inappropriate contact with local police which l
breached Mr H's prlvacy.
ccesslble record of how a
tself
This report recommends that Australia Post should:
review its complaint handling systems with a vlew to providing clearer
guidelines on assessment and management of complaints, and establishlng a
centralised complaint management system accesslble to all complalnt
handling officers
o
ensure that guldelines are avallable to staf on maintalning the confidentiality
of complalnants.

During 2013 Christmas Island experienced unprecedented boat arrivals. As such, there was a
signlflcant impact on all stakeholders involved in the processing of detainees property.
Between March and June 2013 nearly 9,000 IMAs arrived on 125 vessels. This resulted in more than
40,000 detalnee transfers and movements to accommodate the rapidly expanding population. Given
the large number of arrivals, detainees were being transferred to mainland centres or regional
processing centres before their property was processed.
On 18 August 2014, Sally Reeves and Clinton Parker attended a briefíng at Immigration about the
Property Management Plan regarding the property issues on Christmas Island. We also briefly
discussed a review of Indlviduals Allowance Points (IAP) through attendance at Programs and
Activities (P&A)
Discussion Points:
The previously reported 'two' containers of property was only 'one container. The alleged
second container only held welfare property, not detainee property
All (disputed) detainee in-trust property is at NWP
AQIS called for the destruction of damaged and soiled property bags
The remainder falls into four categories:
.
o No known owner
o Owner known, but returned to home country
o SIEV known, individual unknown
o Owner known, property returned unclaimed
The department stated that all reasonable efforts will be made to resolve this long running

Suggestions:

Dear Prime Minister,
Report under Section 16 of the Ombudsman Act 1976
On 20 August 1986 I made a report pursuant to
section 15 of the Ombudsman Act 1976 to the Department of
Defence and the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits
Authority of an investigation of complai
three former
and
of the Defence Force, Messrs
about their retirement benefits.
The investigation of the complaints established
that the three complainants and others who had retired from
the Defence Force after a date towards the end of 1981 had
been denied certain benefits when it was realised that they
were not legally entitled to them because of defectiv
legislation. Members who had retired earlier
receive those benefits, although not legally entitled.
Amending legislation became effective in October 1984, and
payment of arrears of pension and additional commutation
iump sums were thereafter paid to the disadvantaged group.-
In my opinion the actions of the Department of Defence and
the Australian Government Retirement Benefits Office were
administratively defective, and I recommended additional
payments for the persons affected by way of interest,
adjustment for inflation and compensation Eor any
additional income tax resulting from the payment of the
amounts in a lump sum.

The Chairman of the Defence Force Retirement and
Death Benefits Authority responded that if the Government
decided that additional payments would be made the
Authority would be responsible for ensuring calculation and
payment of the amounts concerned. However, the Secreta

Mr Andrew Wilkle MP

HOBART TAS 7000
Dear Mr Wilkie
I am writing to advise that we have finalised the investigation of your complaint about the Australian
Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA)
In our letter of 14 September 2012, we Informed you of AFMA's admission of the fallure of its statutory
committee to comply with s64C(4)(a) of the Fisheries Administration Act 1991 (FA Act). Section
64C(4) a) requires that "[u]nless the committee otherwise determines, the member must not be
present during deliberation by the committee on the matter. The processes relating to a scheduled
meeting of the South East Management Advisory Committee (SEMAC) on 26 March 2012 were not ir
accordance wlth leglslative requirements:
an advisory committee member of SEMAC declaring a financlal confliot of interest in matters
to be discussed by the committee at the meetíng (and to the chalr before the meeting), was
not required by the chair to leave the meeting teleconference fo enable other members to
consider whether the conflicted member could rejoin the teleconference meeting and
participate in disoussions in light of the declared conflicť
the conflicted committee member was allowed by the chair to remain in the meeting and
provide input into discussions about the fishing quota (but not voting on the commlttee's final
position) to be recommended to the AFMA Commission the independent statutory body
charged with setting the Total Allowable Catch' (TAC) for the relevant fishery after first having
consulted with the advisory committee
the conflict of interest consisted of the committee member's commercial Interest in the Śmall
Pelagic Fishery for which a TAC would be recommended by the committee, and a concurrent
finanoial interest in a commercial fishing vessel procured for lts capability to better exploit any
fishing quota held by the member in that fishery. (Theoretically, at least, the "value" of the
conflicted financial interest belng one that would foreseeably and directly be influenced by the
TAC set by the AFMA Gommission after taking SEMAG advice.)
* omisslons of the commitee chalr and other members (including an AFMA staff
representative) to observe mandatory committee processes by moving to exclude the
conflicted member ffom the meéting and then sepärately determlning whether the confllcted
member may be prèsent during deliberations on the conflictéd matter and take part in any
decisiön of thé committee with respect to thé conflcted matter
Other imatteis
We have also reviewed the administrative operations of AFMA's Small Pelägic Fishery Resourcė
Assessment Group (SPFRAG) and lts meeting of 28 February 2012.
nt Ombutls
Poslal Induslry Ombudsman « Taxalion Omibilsman
Disclosed under FO
SPFRAGÍs an expert technical panel which provides SEMAC with'a 'Recommended Biological Catch
(RBC) recommendation for the Small Pelagiç Fishery. The RBC represents a sclentifio assessment of
an approprlate harvest for species living within a given fishery. SEMAC considers the RBC against a
range of commerclal and environmental considerations, including relevant and appliçable harvest
strategles endorsed by AFMA and providès a TAC recommendation on the commercjal catch to the
AFMA Gommission for its consideration and decision
Relevant to our investigation of your complaint was the existence of a common member of both
SPFRAC and SEMAC who was also the 'conflicted committee member noted above, This committee
member attlended both the SPFRAG meeting of 28 February 2012 which determined the RBC and the
SEMAC meeting of 26 March 2012. The committee member declared a similar commercial confliot of
interest to the SPFRAG meeting in February 2012 as wás later declared to the SEMAC meeting in
March 2012. The confliçted SPERAG member did not seek approval to remain at, and participate in,
group deliberations after declaring the conflict
SEMAC meeting papers from 26 March 2012 include evidence of a dissenting view held by two
SPFRAG members. Concerns expressed by the dissenting members in emails appended to the
SEMAC meeting papers indicate some level of dissatisfaction with the draft SPFRAG meeting
summary that was proposed to be provided to SEMAC by the SPFRAG chair. Due to the close tlming
between the SPFRAG and SEMAC meetings, this 'meeting summary' is effectively rélied upon by
SEMAC as representing the views and deliberations of the SPFRAĢ meeting, including its advice on
the RBC for the fishery. AFMA advise that dissenting views of SPFRAG members are provided to the
agençy as a matter of course
The façt that dissenting views were separately provided to SEMAC by the dissenting members
themselves, and not set out in the meeting summary, indicates some deficiency in the formal
communication process from SPFRAG to SEMAC. This represents a risk for AFMA and the AFMA
Commission, as not having all relevant views reflected In the meeting summary has the potential to
undermine the abilty of SEMAÇ to scrutinise related advice and recommendatlons
Although no approval was sought or provided by the SPFRAG meeting for the conflioted member to
emain at, and participate in, group deliberations on matters such as the RBC for the Small Pelagic
Flshery, dilfferent procedural rules - not establlshed under legislation - applied to the SPFRAG
meeting than appled for SEMAC. It may therefore have been open to the ŞPFRAG chair at the
meeting of 28 February 2012 to simply note the conflict of interest in the meeting summary, However,
good administrative practice and meeting procedure would have involved conslderation of the conflict
in light of the lmportance of the matters to be disoussed by the group. A separate determlnatlon of the
approprlateness of the conflicted member remaining in those deliberations would then be made by the
members. We understand that AFMA is addressing the need for robust meeting procedures and
related issues more broadly
To the extent that the dissenting views of the two SPFRAG members were made available to the
SEMAC meeting in March and were also conveyed to the AFMA Commission, any direct detriment
that may have arisen from an allegedly-incomplete meeting summary has been effectively overçome
should be noted that some conflicting evidence was encountered in the course of our investigation
as to whether the dissenting views were actually expressed at the SPFRAG meeting in February or
represented later reflections by the dissenting members on the matters discussed. For our purposes,
his was not an Issue that required further assessment. The introduction of audio recordings of
SPFRAG meetlngs by AFMA may prevent this issue arising in future
As a result of this investigation, AFMA has reminded its advisory groups and commitees of the
correct pröcèdures in relation to handling conflict of interést and reflecting dissenting opinlons in
meeting summaries. Föllowing our further disoussions with AFMA, the agency has provided more
detailed particulars of its remedial actions to date. In our view, the responses by AFMA have.been
both necessary and appropriate in the circumstances

Validity of the 'Total Allowable Catch' decision
We have considered the related administrative issue that you raised of the validity of the TAC set by
the AFMA Commişsion for the Small Pelagic Fishery in circumstances where a breach of the FA Act
has been admltted by AFMA.
The AFMA Commission is an independent entity composed of individuals appointed by the Minister
for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. The Commisslon exercises declsion-making powers under the
Fisheries Management Aot 1991 (FM Act) and the FA Aot. One of these decision-making powers is
the setting of the TAC applicable to the Small Pelagic Fishery
The TAC decision is required to be made after the Commlssion consults with the fishing industry and
other stakeholders and n accordance with AFMA's legislative objectives, The TAC is given legal
effect as a statutory instrument mąde by. AFMA in accordance with a resolution of the Commission
ynder the FM Act and the Small Pelagiç Fishery Management Plan 2009, The instrument is recorded
on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments and the TAC takes effect under law from the day
after it is registered.
Under the legislation, the Commission could validly exerclse Its powers to set the TAC for a fishery at
a level that differs from its advişofy committee's recommendation, Accordingly, it does not necessarily
follow that errors in the SEMAC process operate to inyalidate the TAC setting decision by the
Commission
Review offisherles legislation
We note the terms of reference for the review of fisheries legislation by David Borthwick AO PSM. To
the extent that we have formed relevant vlews on the statutory regime underpinning AFMA's advisory
committee system as a result of our investigation, these views have been advised to the legislation
revlew by the Commonwealth Ombudsman, Colin Neave, in accordance with the review's terms of
reference. Accordingly, It is not appropriate for our office to make further comment on these matters.
Conclusion of investigation
As a result of our Investigation, AFMA has undertaken a range of remedlal and corrective steps ta
address substantive issues arlsing from your complaint: A list of the actions to date is provided at
Attachment1
In an effort to further ensure that AFMA and the AFMA Commission are aware of the issues identified
In the course of.our inyestigation, I am providing a copy of this letter to the Chief Executive Officer of

Dear Mr Wilkie
I am writing to advise that we have finalised the investigation of your complaint about the Australian
Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA)
In our letter of 14 September 2012, we Informed you of AFMA's admission of the fallure of its statutory
committee to comply with s64C(4)(a) of the Fisheries Administration Act 1991 (FA Act). Section
64C(4) a) requires that "[u]nless the committee otherwise determines, the member must not be
present during deliberation by the committee on the matter. The processes relating to a scheduled
meeting of the South East Management Advisory Committee (SEMAC) on 26 March 2012 were not ir
accordance wlth leglslative requirements:
an advisory committee member of SEMAC declaring a financlal confliot of interest in matters
to be discussed by the committee at the meetíng (and to the chalr before the meeting), was
not required by the chair to leave the meeting teleconference fo enable other members to
consider whether the conflicted member could rejoin the teleconference meeting and
participate in disoussions in light of the declared conflicť
the conflicted committee member was allowed by the chair to remain in the meeting and
provide input into discussions about the fishing quota (but not voting on the commlttee's final
position) to be recommended to the AFMA Commission the independent statutory body
charged with setting the Total Allowable Catch' (TAC) for the relevant fishery after first having
consulted with the advisory committee
the conflict of interest consisted of the committee member's commercial Interest in the Śmall
Pelagic Fishery for which a TAC would be recommended by the committee, and a concurrent
finanoial interest in a commercial fishing vessel procured for lts capability to better exploit any
fishing quota held by the member in that fishery. (Theoretically, at least, the "value" of the
conflicted financial interest belng one that would foreseeably and directly be influenced by the
TAC set by the AFMA Gommission after taking SEMAG advice.)
* omisslons of the commitee chalr and other members (including an AFMA staff
representative) to observe mandatory committee processes by moving to exclude the
conflicted member ffom the meéting and then sepärately determlning whether the confllcted

We have also reviewed the administrative operations of AFMA's Small Pelägic Fishery Resourcė
Assessment Group (SPFRAG) and lts meeting of 28 February 2012.

Disclosed under FO
SPFRAGÍs an expert technical panel which provides SEMAC with'a 'Recommended Biological Catch
(RBC) recommendation for the Small Pelagiç Fishery. The RBC represents a sclentifio assessment of
an approprlate harvest for species living within a given fishery. SEMAC considers the RBC against a
range of commerclal and environmental considerations, including relevant and appliçable harvest
strategles endorsed by AFMA and providès a TAC recommendation on the commercjal catch to the
AFMA Gommission for its consideration and decision
Relevant to our investigation of your complaint was the existence of a common member of both
SPFRAC and SEMAC who was also the 'conflicted committee member noted above, This committee
member attlended both the SPFRAG meeting of 28 February 2012 which determined the RBC and the
SEMAC meeting of 26 March 2012. The committee member declared a similar commercial confliot of
interest to the SPFRAG meeting in February 2012 as wás later declared to the SEMAC meeting in
March 2012. The confliçted SPERAG member did not seek approval to remain at, and participate in,
group deliberations after declaring the conflict
SEMAC meeting papers from 26 March 2012 include evidence of a dissenting view held by two
SPFRAG members. Concerns expressed by the dissenting members in emails appended to the
SEMAC meeting papers indicate some level of dissatisfaction with the draft SPFRAG meeting
summary that was proposed to be provided to SEMAC by the SPFRAG chair. Due to the close tlming
between the SPFRAG and SEMAC meetings, this 'meeting summary' is effectively rélied upon by
SEMAC as representing the views and deliberations of the SPFRAĢ meeting, including its advice on
the RBC for the fishery. AFMA advise that dissenting views of SPFRAG members are provided to the
agençy as a matter of course
The façt that dissenting views were separately provided to SEMAC by the dissenting members
themselves, and not set out in the meeting summary, indicates some deficiency in the formal
communication process from SPFRAG to SEMAC. This represents a risk for AFMA and the AFMA
Commission, as not having all relevant views reflected In the meeting summary has the potential to
undermine the abilty of SEMAÇ to scrutinise related advice and recommendatlons
Although no approval was sought or provided by the SPFRAG meeting for the conflioted member to
emain at, and participate in, group deliberations on matters such as the RBC for the Small Pelagic
Flshery, dilfferent procedural rules - not establlshed under legislation - applied to the SPFRAG
meeting than appled for SEMAC. It may therefore have been open to the ŞPFRAG chair at the
meeting of 28 February 2012 to simply note the conflict of interest in the meeting summary, However,
good administrative practice and meeting procedure would have involved conslderation of the conflict
in light of the lmportance of the matters to be disoussed by the group. A separate determlnatlon of the
approprlateness of the conflicted member remaining in those deliberations would then be made by the
members. We understand that AFMA is addressing the need for robust meeting procedures and
related issues more broadly
To the extent that the dissenting views of the two SPFRAG members were made available to the
SEMAC meeting in March and were also conveyed to the AFMA Commission, any direct detriment
that may have arisen from an allegedly-incomplete meeting summary has been effectively overçome
should be noted that some conflicting evidence was encountered in the course of our investigation
as to whether the dissenting views were actually expressed at the SPFRAG meeting in February or
represented later reflections by the dissenting members on the matters discussed. For our purposes,
his was not an Issue that required further assessment. The introduction of audio recordings of
SPFRAG meetlngs by AFMA may prevent this issue arising in future
As a result of this investigation, AFMA has reminded its advisory groups and commitees of the
correct pröcèdures in relation to handling conflict of interést and reflecting dissenting opinlons in
meeting summaries. Föllowing our further disoussions with AFMA, the agency has provided more
detailed particulars of its remedial actions to date. In our view, the responses by AFMA have.been
both necessary and appropriate in the circumstances

Validity of the 'Total Allowable Catch' decision
We have considered the related administrative issue that you raised of the validity of the TAC set by
the AFMA Commişsion for the Small Pelagic Fishery in circumstances where a breach of the FA Act
has been admltted by AFMA.
The AFMA Commission is an independent entity composed of individuals appointed by the Minister
for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. The Commisslon exercises declsion-making powers under the
Fisheries Management Aot 1991 (FM Act) and the FA Aot. One of these decision-making powers is
the setting of the TAC applicable to the Small Pelagic Fishery
The TAC decision is required to be made after the Commlssion consults with the fishing industry and
other stakeholders and n accordance with AFMA's legislative objectives, The TAC is given legal
effect as a statutory instrument mąde by. AFMA in accordance with a resolution of the Commission
ynder the FM Act and the Small Pelagiç Fishery Management Plan 2009, The instrument is recorded
on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments and the TAC takes effect under law from the day
after it is registered.
Under the legislation, the Commission could validly exerclse Its powers to set the TAC for a fishery at
a level that differs from its advişofy committee's recommendation, Accordingly, it does not necessarily
follow that errors in the SEMAC process operate to inyalidate the TAC setting decision by the
Commission
Review offisherles legislation
We note the terms of reference for the review of fisheries legislation by David Borthwick AO PSM. To
the extent that we have formed relevant vlews on the statutory regime underpinning AFMA's advisory
committee system as a result of our investigation, these views have been advised to the legislation
revlew by the Commonwealth Ombudsman, Colin Neave, in accordance with the review's terms of
reference. Accordingly, It is not appropriate for our office to make further comment on these matters.
Conclusion of investigation
As a result of our Investigation, AFMA has undertaken a range of remedlal and corrective steps ta
address substantive issues arlsing from your complaint: A list of the actions to date is provided at

In an effort to further ensure that AFMA and the AFMA Commission are aware of the issues identified

Dear Mr Harris
Commission Research Project: International Education Services
I am writing in response to the invitation to comment on the Commission's current research
project concerning incentives for, and barriers to, the international education market
focussing on the student visa program
Student visa arrangements are relevant to my role as Commonwealth and Overseas
Students Ombudsman. In the Commonwealth Ombudsman jurisdiction we investigate
complaints about the administration of visa processing by the Department of Immigration
and Border Protection (DIBP). In the Overseas Students Ombudsman jurisdiction issues
surrounding student visas and immigration integrity can be relevant to complaints and
appeals that we investigate under the Education Services For Overseas Students (ESOS)
legislative framework.
I trust the following attached documents will be of interest to the Commission
The Commonwealth Ombudsman submission to the DIBP in response to its
consultation on the future direction of Streamlined Visa Processing, and
The Overseas Students Ombudsman submission to the Department of Education
(DE) in response to its consultation on the Reform of the ESOS Framework.

If you or your staff have any questions regarding the above documents, you are welcome to

Introduction
Maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Ombudsman's office
services and information is extremely important to office reputation and function. The
Information and Communication Technology (ICT) systems are pivotal to this security and
are susceptible to threats. These threats are constantly changing; therefore the office
needs to be continually vigilant in defending itself against security issues.

Commonwealth Ombudsman's Report
Monitoring Closing the Gap Programs in the Northern Territory
January - June 2012
The Ombudsman's office has provided independent oversight and a complaints service for
the NTER and other Indigenous programs in the Northern Territory (NT) since August 2007
The NTER has ceased however a number of programs will continue under the Government's
tronger Futures in the NT initiative. The office did not receive funding to continue its
dedicated role in relation to Stronger Future programs in the NT. The funding previously
received under the NTER allowed the office to conduct outreach to Indigenous communities
in the NT to ensure people had access to an independent complaints service and so that we
could gain better insight as to the impacts of services and programs at the local level
Over the past five years, the Ombudsman's office has investigated complaints, worked with
agencies to resolve systemic issues, established relationships with a range of stakeholders
and visited 73 prescribed communities and town camps in the NT at least once. This work
has allowed us to gain a unique insight into the impacts of government programs on
Indigenous people in the NT and as a result we have facilitated the early identification and
resolution of a range of administrative problems
Below are some examples from this reporting period of cases where this office identified
problems in government administration and obtained remedies for those affected
Community building wrongly handed to the shire was returned
Ms A complained to this office that the local shire had taken over a building which belonged
to the parish and despite her efforts to raise this with the shire and the Government Business
Manager, she had not been successful in having the building returned to the parish
Our investigation established that when the local community councils were replaced by the
shires, FaHCSIA, as the administrator of the Commonwealth's statutory five year lease
granted permission to the shires to allow them to use the assets and buildings previously
used by the community council for local government business and services
In granting this permission to the shires, FaHCSIA relied on lists of assets and buildings that
the NT government provided, identifying which houses and buildings were noted as being
used for shire business. FaHCSIA's permission to the shire was only valid to the extent there
was not a pre-existing interest over a property. However, prior to issuing the permission to
the shire, FaHCSIA did not inform the community of its proposed actions or consult with
them to establish whether there were in fact any pre existing interests over any of the
properties identified for shire business
Consequently, communities were unaware that FaHCSIA had granted permission to the
shire to use assets and buildings in the community for shire business until some years later
and the community did not have the opportunity to dispute the shire's use of assets such as
community houses or buildings
As a result of this complaint, FaHCSIA convened a meeting between the parish and the
shire and an agreement was reached that the land and building would be returned to the
parish. FaHCSIA also provided information to the community via flyers and a factsheet to
inform people about plans for community housing, buildings and property after the five year
leases expire
One size does not fit all Individualised service assists an IM customer
Mr B complained to our office in January 2012 that Income Management (IM) was causing
him financial difficulties. He said that he had unsuccessfully sought an exemption from IM
He explained that he lives on the property of a mining company and has limited living
expenses: he does not pay rent, phone or electricity bills. Due to his limited living expenses,
Mr B was having difficulty using all of his IM funds to pay for priority goods. Mr B had been
raising this problem with Centrelink for some time. But the options suggested by Centrelink
such as transferring funds to a store so that Mr B could shop at the store using his IM funds
did not resolve the ongoing problem for Mr B
We acknowledged that Mr B did not qualify for an exemption from IM. However, after
discussing this matter with Mr B, we identified that a core issue for him was that his living
circumstances were such that he was able to meet all of his priority needs with only part of
his IM funds. This meant there was a portion of funds which remained in his IM account
which he could not easily access because of his remote locality or utilise due to his minimal
living expenses. We raised with Centrelink whether it was able to consider Mr B for
unrestricted cash payments an option allowing Centrelink to provide IM funds to a
customer via cash payments where the customer could demonstrate that their priority needs
had been met. After facilitating contact between Mr B and Centrelink, Centrelink arranged
for Mr B to receive regular unrestricted cash payments
Houses made safe after lengthy delays
Mr C and Mr D, two people who live in different remote NT communities, complained about
delays in the NT government undertaking modifications to their houses which were needed
to make them safe. Both Mr C and Mr D had disabilities and used motorised scooters. An NT
agency had assessed both houses and determined that modifications in the form of ramps,
hand rails and changes to the bathrooms were required. In early to mid 2011, the agency
notified the NT government of the required modifications by sending reports with
recommendations.
In February 2012, when this office received the complaints, we established that no actiorn
had been taken to progress these modifications. Following an investigation, a work order
was issued on 20 February 2012 and the majority of the work was completed in March 2012.
We expressed concern to FaHCSIA and the NT government that these complaints
highlighted weaknesses in their management of disability modifications and repairs and
maintenance of houses. FaHCSIA and DHLGRS advised that it had engaged consultants to
report on the end-to-end process for the completion of works and that it was taking steps to
strengthen its processes for managing disability modification and repair and maintenance
requests

Compensation arrangements honoured
Mr E complained that FaHCSIA had not honoured a compensation agreement relating to
accidental damage of a sacred site. Community compensation had been agreed in the form
of a tractor and a truck, and a storage compound to house the vehicles. The Shire
purchased the vehicles with money from FaHCSIA, but then used them in other communities
until the truck broke down. The compound was not built
We established that the terms of the compensation had not been documented at the time the
compensation arrangements were made. Following our investigation, FaHCSIA agreed to
meet with the parties, formalise the terms of the compensation arrangements and discuss
guidelines surrounding the usage and storage of the tip truck and tractor. The truck has
since been repaired and the storage compound built
Importance of accessible and effective complaints mechanisms
Independent research commissioned by this office supports the feedback we have received
from Indigenous people in the NT-that is, they have valued the opportunity to raise issues
with us and have them investigated by an independent agency; they have valued the face to
face approach and have felt more comfortable to discuss issues or raise complaints in
person; and that they are motivated to raise issues even where their circumstance cannot be
changed but where it may lead to improvements for others. We commissioned independent
research to improve Ombudsman services to Indigenous Australians. The findings are
applicable to all agencies and this research can be found on our website, together with our
own observations of areas for improvement in agency communication and engagement with
Indigenous communities.
This office has consistently relayed to agencies the need to have robust and effective
complaints mechanisms in place. Complaints provide a rich source of information about the
service delivery experience from the perspective of the end user. They provide an
opportunity for agencies to identify problems early and take remedial action. For those
agencies working with remote Indigenous communities, extra attention needs to be given to
ensuring any complaints service is accessible to those living remotely. Agencies have a
responsibility to ensure pathways to complain or seek information are visible and understood
by all people who are affected by an agency's programs or services
An accessible complaints service requires more than a dedicated 1800 number or local
government official who people can talk to. Accessible and meaningful complaints services
for Indigenous people in the NT should also feature
Agencies getting the message to people that they value complaints and feedback
that they see complaints as an opportunity to improve, that it is ok for people to
complain and that their complaint will be taken seriously. This will assist to dispel any
misconceptions that there is no point in complaining as agencies do not welcome
complaints
Where more than one agency is involved in a program or service or where an agency
has contracted a third party to provide a service, complaints need to be dealt with
holistically with a firm focus on providing a remedy for the individual
Government officials who interact with the public should be encouraged to listen to

Government officials who interact with the public should be encouraged to listen to
people's questions, queries or personal circumstances and use the interaction as an
opportunity to assess whether the person has experienced problems or issues with a
service or a process. It is often difficult for people to articulate their complaint or know
that their circumstances warrant complaining. Government officials, who know their
agency's business, should be proactive in considering whether there are adverse
impacts or concerns resulting from their agency's programs, services or decisions
Agencies need well established working relationships with stakeholders
representatives and advocates to assist them to identify and resolve issues on behalf
of their clients
Using interpreters when talking to people where English may not be their first
language to ensure the agency understands the person's concern or personal
circumstances and that the person understands their options.
Taking the opportunity to explain to people the program, service, process, obligation
or entitlement to ensure they understand how it works and what they can do if they
are concerned or dissatisfied.
Focusing on identifying a remedy for the person quickly and taking action to fix a
problem
Managing the complainant's expectations as to possible remedies or outcomes and
having these discussions early with the person to avoid disappointment.
The capacity for an agency to look over complaints and identify common themes or
systemic problems requiring action.
The ability for frontline staff to escalate a complex or intractable matter to a more
senior officer for attention and/or approval to take the necessary action to fix.
Encouraging staff to problem solve and re-build relationships with clients and the
public where things have gone wrong
Ensuring there is local advertising and contact information about complaints
processes and avenues for raising concerns with an agency.
Establishing agreed ways of communicating with people about their complaint so that
a person knows how and when they should expect to hear from the agency.
Providing written information to people about decisions or outcomes

.
.
Providing an accessible complaints and review process is a fundamental component of good
public administration. The Ombudsman's office is committed to working with agencies to
improve internal complaint handling, with a particular focus on accessibility for Indigenous
people living in remote NT communities
Complaints investigated by this office throughout the duration of the NTER and Closing the
Gap initiatives in the NT, have identified a number of important areas of public administration
requiring improvement. We have valued the opportunity to work closely with Indigenous
people, stakeholders and agencies to improve services, programs and government decision
making.
Although our resources will not extend to continuing our extensive outreach program to
remote Indigenous communities in the NT, we are considering options to ensure that our
independent oversight of Stronger Futures in the NT continues

Copyright Act 1968
Copyright protects intellectual property rights in literary (including computer programs),
dramatic, musical and artistic works (includes photographs/charts/maps) and in
films/videos, recordings/tapes and TV and radio broadcasts. Use of any part of a
copyright work without permission of the copyright owner will infringe copyright unless
proved otherwise
Infringement of copyright will expose a user to personal liability for damages
Examples of infringement of copyright (if undertaken without the permission of the
copyright owner), includes:
1.
converting a CD to another audio format, such as MP3, and using it on a PC
downloading a film, MP3 recordings, or software from the internet using office IT
infrastructure, internet access or computers
2.
uploading audio files, video files, software or commercial photographs, to the
office websites and making these available to the public
advertising links to websites that directly offer copyright infringing material or
direct users to copyright infringing material, including audio files such as MP3
recordings, video files, software or commercial photographs

Copyright infringement could apply to any file format
Trade Marks Act 1995
A user must not copy a trademark or logo belonging to another party. Trademark
infringement may expose the user to liability for damages.
Trade Practices Act 1974
The Trade Practices Act contains provisions which prohibit passing off and misleading
and deceptive conduct. For example, if a user were to copy material from an external site
onto the office website (including features such as logos and trademarks) so that persons
accessing the website would believe that office had been authorised to carry the material,
this would constitute passing off or deceptive or misleading conduct.
Spam Act 2003
This legislation sets up a scheme for regulating commercial e-mail and other types of
commercial electronic messages. Under the Act, users must not send unsolicited
commercial electronic messages, i.e. messages that are sent without the recipient's
consent. Any commercial messages that are sent electronically (including email, instant

State and Commonwealth legislation prohibits discrimination on the basis of age,
impairment/imputed impairment, industrial activity, lawful sexual activity, marital status,
physical features, political belief or activity, pregnancy, race, religious belief or activity,
sex, parental status or status as a carer. It is also prohibited to victimise a person who
has made a complaint of discrimination under these Acts.
Defamation
A user must not publish a statement about another person (or entity) which could harm
that other person's (or entity's) reputation. There is no need for the person to have been
named specifically if he/she can reasonably be identified. Photographs and cartoons can
also be defamatory if they hold someone up to ridicule or contempt. In a defamation case,
truth is not always a defence
Illegal material
Commonwealth and State laws prohibit publication of hard core pornography (in particular
where it involves children, bestiality, violence, cruelty and/or exploitation). A breach of
these laws would constitute a criminal offence and will also result in disciplinary action
under the office's disciplinary procedures. Office rules prohibit any use of office
equipment for viewing, storing or distributing sexually explicit, discriminatory, political or
potentially offensive material.

encryption of electronic data; identification and authentication for all software; restrictions
on personal computer connections to local area networks (LANS), wireless local area
networks (WLANS), wireless wide area networks (WWANS) and public networks such as
the internet; use of firewalls to control and audit access between networks; measures to
detect and eradicate computer viruses; and other intrusion detection mechanisms. Based
upon these Government guidelines, these systems are installed as recommended to
maintain compliance and are regularly reviewed for compliance purposes.

Appendix B: Management of passwords
Passwords
All hardware, including desktops, laptops and mobile phone are secured by passwords.
Passwords are the 'keys' that unlock computers and other equipment. Your login details
(username and password) should be treated like your bank PIN and protected at all
costs. You are responsible for this information and should never share your password
with anyone
If someone has your password and logs into your account you will be held responsible for
their actions. A third party can cause havoc to the office by deleting files, reading
confidential emails, sending offensive or abusive emails, sending spam emails or entering
into financial transactions on your behalf and running up large bills
Change your password often
As passwords can be captured and cracked over time, ICT encourages you to change
your Ombudsman password monthly. Please note ICT has built a password change
prompt into Windows that will prompt you if you have not changed your password in the
last three months (90 days). This must be completed to re-establish your logon capability.
ICT recommends that you do not use your Ombudsman password on any other network
or internet site

Choose good passwords
Choosing a good password is a very important part of network security. Modern cracking
software applications, contain extensive lists of commonly used passwords, including
entire dictionaries, lists of names, lists of movie names lists of common pet names etc.
A good password is all of the following
e compliant to DSD requirements for password complexity
e easy to remember
e hard to guess
A good password does/should NOT:
e contain words that are in ANY dictionary
e contain names of any kind
e contain your user name
e contain dates (in any format)
be written down, emailed or given to anyone (an administrator should never need
your password)

Choosing a password that is all of these things can be difficult. Here are some tricks that
may help you
1. Misspell words in unusual ways
2. Replace names with private nicknames
3. Use a phrase. Obscure song lyrics are a good example
4. Use an acronym of a long phrase
5. Use second, third or last letter acronyms
6. Capitalise and punctuate incorrectly
7. Insert unusual characters in the middle of words (eg LA)
8. Replace letters with other characters/symbols
9. Make letters out of symbols (eg IHLVI3 L)
You should use several of these tricks together to make a good password. Using these
tricks, you should be able to generate 15 to 20 good passwords that are relatively easy
for you to remember.
The easiest way to choose a good password is to think of a sentence (perhaps a line from
a song or poem). Then, use the first letter of every word in that sentence to make up your
password. An example being 'I like working at the Ombudsman's office because it's
secure' would be: ilwatoobis. Throw in a random piece of punctuation in your passwords
to make them even less likely to be guessed such as 'lilwatoobis' Then throw in a random
capitalisation and you have a secure password, eg "lilwatoobis'.

Classification of Emails and Documents
Our office system is secure for 'In-Confidence' material. Classification of the office
environment has been determined following independent assessment against
government policy and guidelines (PSM and ACSI 33) and the office's internal security
controls. The policy and procedures are subject to periodic review against the
recommended procedures.
Staff should note that:
information above the level of 'IN-CONFIDENCE' should not be stored on the office
network infrastructure or applications
IN-CONFIDENCE' classifications can be used when sending secure email to other
Australian Government agencies using FedLink (see below)
connectivity outside the local office environment such as to the Internet is inherently
insecure. You should exercise caution when you send personal or confidential
information externally.
Connection to FEDLINK
FedLink is a network connection that enables secure communications between Australian
Government agencies. It is an encryption mechanism that provides secure and trusted
communications across the internet. This allows Commonwealth departments and
agencies to transmit and receive information securely up to and including the
classification of their own network (on our case 'In-Confidence')
Our ICT team have established network connectivity to the Fedlink network via a Secure
Internet Gateway. The environment has been configured in Microsoft Exchange/Outlook
to enable sending and receiving of classified emails to the level of 'In-Confidence'. This
means that we can only send or receive material classified at the X-IN-CONFIDENCE

Appendix A: Government policy and legislation
A number of overarching legislative and policy documents govern the management of
information and ICT security which has a significant bearing on the way staff can use
electronic and ICT resources. Of importance to the office are
Copyright Act 1968
Copyright protects intellectual property rights in literary (including computer programs),
dramatic, musical and artistic works (includes photographs/charts/maps) and in
films/videos, recordings/tapes and TV and radio broadcasts. Use of any part of a
copyright work without permission of the copyright owner will infringe copyright unless
proved otherwise
Infringement of copyright will expose a user to personal liability for damages
Examples of infringement of copyright (if undertaken without the permission of the
copyright owner), includes:
1.
converting a CD to another audio format, such as MP3, and using it on a PC
downloading a film, MP3 recordings, or software from the internet using office IT
infrastructure, internet access or computers
2.
uploading audio files, video files, software or commercial photographs, to the
office websites and making these available to the public
advertising links to websites that directly offer copyright infringing material or
direct users to copyright infringing material, including audio files such as MP3
recordings, video files, software or commercial photographs
3.
4.
5. sending copyright material, including audio files, such as MP3 recordings, video
files, commercial photographs or software, to another person using the office
infrastructure such as email
storing copyright material, including audio files, such as MP3 recordings, video
files, commercial photographs or software, on office computers or servers

Copyright infringement could apply to any file format
Trade Marks Act 1995
A user must not copy a trademark or logo belonging to another party. Trademark
infringement may expose the user to liability for damages.
Trade Practices Act 1974
The Trade Practices Act contains provisions which prohibit passing off and misleading
and deceptive conduct. For example, if a user were to copy material from an external site
onto the office website (including features such as logos and trademarks) so that persons
accessing the website would believe that office had been authorised to carry the material,
this would constitute passing off or deceptive or misleading conduct.
Spam Act 2003
This legislation sets up a scheme for regulating commercial e-mail and other types of
commercial electronic messages. Under the Act, users must not send unsolicited
commercial electronic messages, i.e. messages that are sent without the recipient's
consent. Any commercial messages that are sent electronically (including email, instant

organisation which authorised the sending of the message and provide for a functional
unsubscribe facility.
Anti-discrimination legislation
State and Commonwealth legislation prohibits discrimination on the basis of age,
impairment/imputed impairment, industrial activity, lawful sexual activity, marital status,
physical features, political belief or activity, pregnancy, race, religious belief or activity,
sex, parental status or status as a carer. It is also prohibited to victimise a person who
has made a complaint of discrimination under these Acts.
Defamation
A user must not publish a statement about another person (or entity) which could harm
that other person's (or entity's) reputation. There is no need for the person to have been
named specifically if he/she can reasonably be identified. Photographs and cartoons can
also be defamatory if they hold someone up to ridicule or contempt. In a defamation case,
truth is not always a defence
Illegal material
Commonwealth and State laws prohibit publication of hard core pornography (in particular
where it involves children, bestiality, violence, cruelty and/or exploitation). A breach of
these laws would constitute a criminal offence and will also result in disciplinary action
under the office's disciplinary procedures. Office rules prohibit any use of office
equipment for viewing, storing or distributing sexually explicit, discriminatory, political or
potentially offensive material.
Incitement to commit a crime
Users must not publish material which is an incitement to commit or instruction in crime
eg, material on how to prepare explosive devices, or how to stea

Xmas Party [SEC-UNCLASSIFIED]
Security Classification:
UNCLASSIFIED
All
Last year I sent out the message below and it is probably worth me sending it out again. I am keen to
encourage attendance at our Christmas party and hopefully this will make the rules clear.
Canberra staff have been given information about our annual Xmas party- an event not to be missed. I am
not sure what the arrangements are in each State office but thought I should set out the technical details
of attendance and work time.
For the Canberra office attendance at the official Xmas party is to be counted as work. Attendance is
voluntary. If you don't attend you are expected to be at work (or on approved leave) as this is not another
unofficial half day holiday, it is support for an office event. Some teams may also have a team celebration
but that is expected to be a lunchtime affair, not another afternoon off work.
is.
For each of the State offices the same arrangement applies- attendance at the office Xmas party for one
afternoon can be recorded as attendance at work, but again attendance is voluntary and we can give only
one afternoon for attendance. Those not attending are expected to be at work.
As a final note l should point out that although the office Xmas party is entirely optional, and office Xmas
parties often have a bad reputation, this office does a great Xmas party. If you come along I am sure you
will have lots of fun, and it is always rewarding to spend a bit of social time with colleagues from the office.
(Having sald that, I have to tender my own apologies as I will be in PNG on the day. I am very sorry to miss
àn occasion that I have been looking forward to for some time!! ®)

Review
1. Authorised use of information technology
Information technology (IT) facilities are provided by the Ombudsman's office (the office")
only for the purpose of enabling authorised users to conduct government business, or
performing the functions of the Ombudsman's office. These facilities include all computer
and computer-related facilities, Internet connections, internal and external electronic mail,
telephones and facsimiles. Authorised users include officers and contract staff specificall;y
authorised to make use of the office's IT facilities
When using IT facilities to conduct government business, or functions of the Ombudsman's
office, users should be sensitive to the nature of information being accessed or created and
ensure that appropriate security is involved in saving, copying or transmitting data.
Authorised users are not permitted to make use of the office's IT facilities for unacceptable
uses. Unacceptable uses are described below. The office will accept incidental personal use
of IT facilities provided that its impact on the office is negligible. Guidance on incidental
personal use is provided below
top
0
2. Unacceptable uses
Unacceptable uses of the office's IT facilities include:
any use in breach of a Commonwealth law or the Australian Public Service (APS)
Code of Conduct
distributing material that is harmful to, or that conflicts with, the interests of the
Commonwealth or the office
breaching intellectual property rights, including copyright on software
interfering with the authorised use of the IT facilities by others
o
DISCLOSED UNDER FO
intentionally disrupting the operation of the IT facilities, spreading viruses with intent
to cause harm or gaining unauthorised access to a computer system
gaining unauthorised access to information and/or altering, deleting, inserting, or
damaging that information
using the IT facilities for private commercial activities, or private activities such as
on-line' gambling, or advertising such as in relation to political activity[1]
intercepting another person's communications or e-mail without permission from the
individual, or without the direction from the individual's manager
importing, creating, intentionally accessing, possessing or distributing any offensive,
obscene or indecent images, data or other material including material which has as its
main focus pornography, nudity or sexual acts
distributing defamatory, abusive, sexist or racist material or material likely to promote
conflict or to incite violence against identifiable groups
distributing chain letters
distributing e-mail anonymously, using a false identity or using another person's user
identification
o
o
using internal contact lists, addresses or e-mail contacts for personal circulation (i.e.
for non-official purposes) to external organisations or individuals
distributing communications or e-mail that disclose personal information (including
telephone numbers or e-mail addresses) without appropriate authorisation
intentionally using the IT facilities to harass, intimidate, threaten or offend another
person
o
top
3. Advice
Further information and advice on the interpretation of these guidelines should be sought in
the first instance from your regional manager. Advice should always be sought in cases
where there is doubt as to whether a particular use is unacceptable or not.
0
While e-mail should not be used to disseminate union material, office management may
sanction its use for specific activities such as negotiation of the office's certified agreement.
The use of IT facilities for personal financial transactions, such as internet banking for
convenience, is permitted on the understanding that the responsibility for the transaction is
solely your responsibility and is undertaken in your own time. This includes responsibility for
transaction content and technical support. The Ombudsman's office will not be held liable for
any financial loss incurred though using the office facilities for personal financial
transactions, whether the loss is due to systems failure or any other reason. Staff need to
ensure that this type of transaction does not disrupt the operation of the IT facilities or
interrupt on-going office work
4. Responsibility
All members of staff in the office who use the IT services such as e-mail and the internet are
responsible for:

contents being generated by your e-mail account
managing your e-mail environment by deleting all unnecessary or unsolicited
from your account at the earliest possibility

not attempting to remove or avoid security processes within the IT services and
equipment
notifying supervisors or appropriate managers of any perceived misuse of IT services
securing your workstation from improper use, by regularly changing your password,
not passing your password to other people, activating secure screen-saver and shutting
your workstation down at the end of the working day.
o
top
5. Complaints and investigation
Instances of unacceptable use of the office's IT facilities should be reported in the first
instance to your manager. Where the unacceptable use involves issues you believe fall within
the office harassment guidelines you should bring the matter to the attention of your local
harassment contact officer. Complaints will be investigated by the Director of SSIMU or
management in the first instance or, where necessary, referred to the Australian Federal
Police. Where it involves harassment it will be handled in accordance with the harassment
guidelines.
6. Sanctions for non-compliance A breach of these guidelines may result in disciplinary
action (including dismissal) under the Public Service Act or criminal prosecution or both
top
7. Monitoring of electronic networks
Authorised users should be aware that their use of IT facilities may be monitored for
operational reasons to determine whether the network is operating efficiently and there are no
security breaches. To protect the security of the system and to isolate and resolve problems,
this activity can involve the removal of material from the network and/or the removal of user
accesS
E-mail and internet usage is routinely monitored. Records of transactions can be obtained in
cases of concern or complaint. These records include the e-mail sender and recipient
addresses, and time of transmission. The content of the email would not normally be recorded
but may be stored on mail servers, backups or archives. With web browsing, the addresses of
sites visited, the date and time they were visited and the duration of site visits may be logged
Users should be aware that session content from browsing may be stored in the memory of
network servers and desktop equipment.
A limited number of IT support staff (Director of IT, and the Network System Administrator)
have access to these records as part of their operational duties and the extent of this access
will not exceed the minimum essential for performance of these duties. Normal routine
DISCLOSED UNDER FOI
analysis will not involve reading the content of electronic messages or files. However, if due
to routine analysis or a complaint the Director of IT or Network Systems Administrator
reasonably suspects that an authorised individual is misusing the facilities, further
investigation and action may involve special monitoring and/or reading the contents of
individual electronic messages and files. Any such investigation will be conducted in
accordance with the Privacy Act 1988 and other relevant legislation
office has the capability to investigate the origin and destination of telephone and
facsimile calls made from the office PABXs. Information recorded includes the origin of the
call, called number, duration, and time of day. Telephone and mobile phone accounts are
routinely monitored to identify billing errors and patterns of excessive use, and to certify
expenditure.
taff should also be aware that all e-mail, files and telephone records may be inspected by
authorised IT support staff for the purpose of responding to external persons (for example,
FOI requests) or to bodies such as the Australian Federal Police or the courts. The content of
e-mail and files may also be inspected for the purpose of advising the office management or
in response to internal investigations.

8. Incidental personal use
The office recognises that staff may occasionally wish to take advantage of the convenience
of e-mail, the internet and IT facilities generally for personal purposes. In seeking to maintain
a balance between the needs of the office and the needs of staff, and with regard to the proper
use of public funds, the Ombudsman will accept incidental personal use of IT facilities
provided that: (i) it does not constitute an unacceptable use as detailed above; and (ii) its
impact on the operations of the office is negligible.
Staff should bear in mind the following aspects, which may represent costs to the office of
such personal use:
the time spent in composing, reading, reviewing
time spent in surfing the internet, especially when following up false leads or
distracting internet sites
the use of facsimile and printer resources: paper, toner and maintenance
the use of other resources (server storage space, network traffic, equipment memory
with attachments or downloads of high volume objects such as pictures/video etc)
the interruption to the flow and pattern of work
occupational health issues related to excessive time spent at a computer screen and
keyboard
impact on the work of colleagues, particularly how colleagues may feel about
receiving unsolicited e-mails
o
o
o
o
the risks of viruses, worms, etc: being transferred to computers in the office
the risks of leakage of official information by staff visiting unscrupulous Internet
sites, which may interrogate the browsing workstation.

Whilst it is difficult to establish what is a reasonable level of incidental personal use, sta
should take note of these indicators:
intrusion into one's ability to fulfil required duties is unacceptable
personal use of IT facilities should preferably be confined to times which are outside
of normal working hours
use outside of normal working hours for the pursuit of study or research etc from
ich the office or Commonwealth will benefit, is viewed with greater acceptance
There can be situations where the mere association of a statement or opinion with the name
the office may appear to give an endorsement or authority that is not intended or is
inappropriate. Staff must take care not to create such a situation. Staff should bear in min
that the mere inclusion of their e-mail address on distribution lists of some organisations (e.g.
clubs, political groups) may create an impression that is not consistent with the image of the
office or Commonwealth. Staff should use home e-mail addresses for such purposes.
Staff should note that, whilst the sharing of jokes, etc can contribute to the maintenance of
morale, some staff find these intrusive, and their distribution should be kept to a minimum
Jokes that may be offensive, obscene or otherwise indecent should never be distributed using
facilities provided by the office
Staff should also note (as discussed earlier) that most e-mail is not secure. It should be
regarded as accessible unless it has been encoded or encrypted. E-mail is often compared to a
postcard in that anyone who receives it can read it. E-mail may also be read if it is stored on
servers during transmission. E-mails are hard to destroy. Many people think that if they delete
their e-mail it is gone forever. This is not so as most electronic documents are backed up and
recoverable. Also most networks have transaction logs, and these logs will normally include
the e-mail addresses of senders and recipients of e-mail and the time of transmission. The
content of e-mails themselves would not normally be logged but may be stored on mail
servers. Similarly, web server logs record information on the sites that people visit.
The keeping of these logs is usually necessary for the routine maintenance and management
of networks and systems.

Incidental personal use
Review
1. Authorised use of information technology
Information technology (IT) facilities are provided by the Ombudsman's office (the office")
only for the purpose of enabling authorised users to conduct government business, or
performing the functions of the Ombudsman's office. These facilities include all computer
and computer-related facilities, Internet connections, internal and external electronic mail,
telephones and facsimiles. Authorised users include officers and contract staff specificall;y
authorised to make use of the office's IT facilities
When using IT facilities to conduct government business, or functions of the Ombudsman's
office, users should be sensitive to the nature of information being accessed or created and
ensure that appropriate security is involved in saving, copying or transmitting data.
Authorised users are not permitted to make use of the office's IT facilities for unacceptable
uses. Unacceptable uses are described below. The office will accept incidental personal use
of IT facilities provided that its impact on the office is negligible. Guidance on incidental
personal use is provided below
top
0
2. Unacceptable uses
Unacceptable uses of the office's IT facilities include:
any use in breach of a Commonwealth law or the Australian Public Service (APS)
Code of Conduct
distributing material that is harmful to, or that conflicts with, the interests of the
Commonwealth or the office
breaching intellectual property rights, including copyright on software
interfering with the authorised use of the IT facilities by others
o
DISCLOSED UNDER FO

damaging that information
using the IT facilities for private commercial activities, or private activities such as
on-line' gambling, or advertising such as in relation to political activity[1]
intercepting another person's communications or e-mail without permission from the

3. Advice
Further information and advice on the interpretation of these guidelines should be sought in
the first instance from your regional manager. Advice should always be sought in cases
where there is doubt as to whether a particular use is unacceptable or not.
0
While e-mail should not be used to disseminate union material, office management may
sanction its use for specific activities such as negotiation of the office's certified agreement.
The use of IT facilities for personal financial transactions, such as internet banking for
convenience, is permitted on the understanding that the responsibility for the transaction is
solely your responsibility and is undertaken in your own time. This includes responsibility for
transaction content and technical support. The Ombudsman's office will not be held liable for
any financial loss incurred though using the office facilities for personal financial
transactions, whether the loss is due to systems failure or any other reason. Staff need to
ensure that this type of transaction does not disrupt the operation of the IT facilities or
interrupt on-going office work
4. Responsibility
All members of staff in the office who use the IT services such as e-mail and the internet are
responsible for:
DISCLOSED UNDER FO
contents being generated by your e-mail account
managing your e-mail environment by deleting all unnecessary or unsolicited
from your account at the earliest possibility
material
actively discouraging the use and circulation of 'junk' mail
not altering or dismantling equipment without proper authority
not attempting to remove or avoid security processes within the IT services and
equipment
notifying supervisors or appropriate managers of any perceived misuse of IT services
securing your workstation from improper use, by regularly changing your password,
not passing your password to other people, activating secure screen-saver and shutting
your workstation down at the end of the working day.
o
top
5. Complaints and investigation
Instances of unacceptable use of the office's IT facilities should be reported in the first
instance to your manager. Where the unacceptable use involves issues you believe fall within
the office harassment guidelines you should bring the matter to the attention of your local
harassment contact officer. Complaints will be investigated by the Director of SSIMU or
management in the first instance or, where necessary, referred to the Australian Federal
Police. Where it involves harassment it will be handled in accordance with the harassment
guidelines.
6. Sanctions for non-compliance A breach of these guidelines may result in disciplinary
action (including dismissal) under the Public Service Act or criminal prosecution or both
top
7. Monitoring of electronic networks
Authorised users should be aware that their use of IT facilities may be monitored for
operational reasons to determine whether the network is operating efficiently and there are no
security breaches. To protect the security of the system and to isolate and resolve problems,
this activity can involve the removal of material from the network and/or the removal of user
accesS
E-mail and internet usage is routinely monitored. Records of transactions can be obtained in
cases of concern or complaint. These records include the e-mail sender and recipient
addresses, and time of transmission. The content of the email would not normally be recorded
but may be stored on mail servers, backups or archives. With web browsing, the addresses of
sites visited, the date and time they were visited and the duration of site visits may be logged
Users should be aware that session content from browsing may be stored in the memory of
network servers and desktop equipment.
A limited number of IT support staff (Director of IT, and the Network System Administrator)
have access to these records as part of their operational duties and the extent of this access
will not exceed the minimum essential for performance of these duties. Normal routine
DISCLOSED UNDER FOI
analysis will not involve reading the content of electronic messages or files. However, if due
to routine analysis or a complaint the Director of IT or Network Systems Administrator
reasonably suspects that an authorised individual is misusing the facilities, further
investigation and action may involve special monitoring and/or reading the contents of
individual electronic messages and files. Any such investigation will be conducted in
accordance with the Privacy Act 1988 and other relevant legislation
office has the capability to investigate the origin and destination of telephone and
facsimile calls made from the office PABXs. Information recorded includes the origin of the
call, called number, duration, and time of day. Telephone and mobile phone accounts are
routinely monitored to identify billing errors and patterns of excessive use, and to certify
expenditure.
taff should also be aware that all e-mail, files and telephone records may be inspected by
authorised IT support staff for the purpose of responding to external persons (for example,
FOI requests) or to bodies such as the Australian Federal Police or the courts. The content of
e-mail and files may also be inspected for the purpose of advising the office management or
in response to internal investigations.

8. Incidental personal use
The office recognises that staff may occasionally wish to take advantage of the convenience
of e-mail, the internet and IT facilities generally for personal purposes. In seeking to maintain
a balance between the needs of the office and the needs of staff, and with regard to the proper
use of public funds, the Ombudsman will accept incidental personal use of IT facilities
provided that: (i) it does not constitute an unacceptable use as detailed above; and (ii) its
impact on the operations of the office is negligible.
Staff should bear in mind the following aspects, which may represent costs to the office of
such personal use:
the time spent in composing, reading, reviewing
time spent in surfing the internet, especially when following up false leads or
distracting internet sites
the use of facsimile and printer resources: paper, toner and maintenance
the use of other resources (server storage space, network traffic, equipment memory
with attachments or downloads of high volume objects such as pictures/video etc)
the interruption to the flow and pattern of work
occupational health issues related to excessive time spent at a computer screen and
keyboard
impact on the work of colleagues, particularly how colleagues may feel about
receiving unsolicited e-mails
o
o
o
o
the risks of viruses, worms, etc: being transferred to computers in the office
the risks of leakage of official information by staff visiting unscrupulous Internet
sites, which may interrogate the browsing workstation.

Commonwealth Ombudsman-Email management policy
DSCLOSED UNDER FO
Introduction
anagement of emails within
The purpose of the policy is to establish a framework for the m
the Commonwealth Ombudsman's office. Email is part of the official business
communic
ation of the office. Emails sent or received contain information about business
tivities and can function as evidence of business transactions that are part of the official
records of
Act 1983
the office. They must, therefore, be managed in accordance with the Archives
In addition, staff have a responsibility to assist in management of emails to ensure that
the Outlook system runs efficiently
This policy applies to all Ombudsman staff and contract staff
Sending emails
Personal emails
Incidental personal use of office IT resources, including email is allowed so long as it is
within reasonable limits. Personal emails should be deleted as soon as possible.
However, it is important that staff are aware that there are particular sensitivities
associated with sending personal emails from our office systems. For instance it is
possible that the mere association of a statement or opinion with the name of the office
(as reflected in your email address) may appear to give an endorsement or authority that
is not intended or is inappropriate.
Particular care should be taken when your personal concerns may intersect with a
function of the office (such as a personal complaint to a Commonwealth or ACT
Government department or agency). In addition, you should bear in mind that the mere
inclusion of your email address on distribution lists of some organisations (for example
clubs or political groups) may create an impression that is not consistent with the image
of the office or the Australian Government. In such cases, do not use the office email
system or email address.
If in doubt, please err on the side of caution and use your home email address for such
purposes. If you have any questions on particular instances, please discuss with your
manager, SAO or the SAO Corporate
Inappropriate or offensive emails
Emails that contain material that is racist, sexist or otherwise offensive should not be
sent. Sending such emails is a breach of the APS code of conduct and could lead to
disciplinary action. If you receive offensive emails from someone in the office, you should
let your supervisor or the SAO Corporate know. If you receive offensive emails from
someone outside the office, please delete them immediately and contact the IT helpdesk
if there appears to be a constant issue
The filter rules on junk mail' are set out on the intranet in the Guidelines on SPAM control
and management
All staff emails
In general, information relating to more than one team should be placed on the news
page on the intranet rather than being sent as an all staff email. This reduces the size of
emails being sent and ensures that corporate information is retained in an accessible
central repository. To arrange for documents to be published on the intranet, contact the
Web Services Team via email or phone to discuss details

transaction of business'.
should be recorded
An email is a corporate document if it meets these criteria and
As with other documents, emails relating to simple organisational matters such as
arranging meetings should be deleted once the meeting has occurred
Emails and Resolve
As with other documents, the author of the email or the person who received an email
from an external source is responsible for filing the email. Complaint related emails
should be attached to Resolve. Other emails should either be attached to Resolve or
printed and attached to a formal file.
All emails relating to an approach, whether incoming or outgoing, need to be stored in the
Resolve documents area. You will need to drag and drop or copy and paste each email
into Resolve. This also applies when replying directly to an email in Resolve. Replies are
automatically saved in Outlook. However all emails need to be manually saved as
Resolve documents
Once an email has been recorded on Resolve or attached to a formal file, it should be
removed from Outlook
When to file a mail thread
A mail thread is where there is an initial email and a response has been added to that
initial email (that is, a reply with history).
It is often not clear when to file a mail thread and it is not possible to make 'hard and fast'
rules. Making a record after each addition to the thread will often waste time and possibly
paper and result in duplication of records
It is suggested that you consider that the intent is to make a record of corporate
documents so that a third person should be able to look at a case and understand what
has occurred. Remember that other staff are unable to access the mail thread when it
remains only in your personal Outlook folder. However if the mail thread is bouncing
backwards and forwards in a short space of time, it is time-wasting to record the email at
each addition
It is suggested that the mail thread be copied to Resolve or placed on a file when
you are fairly confident that the mail thread is completed
at the end of a working day
it may be important for other staff to access the email
o
You cannot replace a prior copy of the mail thread in Resolve with an updated version
(you will need to request that the earlier document is deleted). When you add a later
version of the mail thread, you should place a note in Resolve indicating that the later
email is an updated version of the earlier email so that someone conducting a QA knows
that it is unnecessary to look at the earlier email

neighborhood and the Tenderloin. As defined in City Business Tax & Regulations Code

located in downtown San Francisco, generally including: parcels fronting the south side
of Market Street from Eleventh Street to Sixth Street; a portion of parcels fronting the
south side of Market Street from Sixth Street to Fifth Street (odd numbered addresses

non-profits and small businesses through social media skills; and cultivation of an
enduring and organic relationship with the numerous community organizations working
